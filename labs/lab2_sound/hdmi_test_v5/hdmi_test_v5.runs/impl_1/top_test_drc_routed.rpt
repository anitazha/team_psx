2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Physical design rule  
Net icon/CONTROL0[13] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin icon/U0/U_ICON/U_CTRL_OUT/F_NCP[0].F_CMD[9].U_LCE.icon/U0/U_ICON/U_CTRL_OUT/F_NCP[0].F_CMD[9].U_LCE/O, cell icon/U0/U_ICON/U_CTRL_OUT/F_NCP[0].F_CMD[9].U_LCE. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT icon/U0/U_ICON/U_CTRL_OUT/F_NCP[0].F_CMD[9].U_LCE is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    ila/U0/I_YES_D.U_ILA/U_STAT/U_DIRTY_LDC {LDCE}

Related violations: <none>

RTSTAT-10#1 Warning
No routable loads  
265 net(s) have no routable loads. The first 15 problem net(s) are icon/CONTROL0[7], icon/CONTROL0[10], icon/CONTROL0[11], icon/CONTROL0[15], icon/CONTROL0[16], icon/CONTROL0[17], icon/CONTROL0[18], icon/CONTROL0[19], icon/CONTROL0[21], icon/CONTROL0[22], icon/CONTROL0[23], icon/CONTROL0[24], icon/CONTROL0[25], icon/CONTROL0[26], icon/CONTROL0[27].
