GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
**************************

                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


Preamble
========

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT
DOES.
     Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published
by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James
Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

Funding Free Software
*********************

   If you want to have more free software a few years from now, it makes
sense for you to help encourage people to contribute funds for its
development.  The most effective approach known is to encourage
commercial redistributors to donate.

   Users of free software systems can boost the pace of development by
encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their selling price
to free software developers--the Free Software Foundation, and others.

   The way to convince distributors to do this is to demand it and
expect it from them.  So when you compare distributors, judge them
partly by how much they give to free software development.  Show
distributors they must compete to be the one who gives the most.

   To make this approach work, you must insist on numbers that you can
compare, such as, "We will donate ten dollars to the Frobnitz project
for each disk sold."  Don't be satisfied with a vague promise, such as
"A portion of the profits are donated," since it doesn't give a basis
for comparison.

   Even a precise fraction "of the profits from this disk" is not very
meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated business decisions
can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts as profit.
If the price you pay is $50, ten percent of the profit is probably less
than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or nothing at all.

   Some redistributors do development work themselves.  This is useful
too; but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire how much they do,
and what kind.  Some kinds of development make much more long-term
difference than others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of
a program contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of a
program for the whole community contributes much.  Easy new ports
contribute little, since someone else would surely do them; difficult
ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU C compiler contribute more;
major new features or packages contribute the most.

   By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the
proper thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources into making more free software.

Protect Your Freedom--Fight "Look And Feel"
*******************************************

     This section is a political message from the League for Programming
     Freedom to the users of GNU CC.  We have included it here because
     the issue of interface copyright is important to the GNU project.

   Apple and Lotus have tried to create a new form of legal monopoly: a
copyright on a user interface.

   An interface is a kind of language--a set of conventions for
communication between two entities, human or machine.  Until a few years
ago, the law seemed clear: interfaces were outside the domain of
copyright, so programmers could program freely and implement whatever
interface the users demanded.  Imitating de-facto standard interfaces,
sometimes with improvements, was standard practice in the computer
field.  These improvements, if accepted by the users, caught on and
became the norm; in this way, much progress took place.

   Computer users, and most software developers, were happy with this
state of affairs.  However, large companies such as Apple and Lotus
would prefer a different system--one in which they can own interfaces
and thereby rid themselves of all serious competitors.  They hope that
interface copyright will give them, in effect, monopolies on major
classes of software.

   Other large companies such as IBM and Digital also favor interface
monopolies, for the same reason: if languages become property, they
expect to own many de-facto standard languages.  But Apple and Lotus are
the ones who have actually sued.  Lotus has won lawsuits against two
small companies, which were thus put out of business.  Then they sued
Borland; this case is now before the court of appeals.  Apple's lawsuit
against HP and Microsoft is also being decided by an appeals court.
Widespread rumors that Apple had lost the case are untrue; as of July
1994, the final outcome is unknown.

   If the monopolists get their way, they will hobble the software
field:

   * Gratuitous incompatibilities will burden users.  Imagine if each
     car manufacturer had to design a different way to start, stop, and
     steer a car.

   * Users will be "locked in" to whichever interface they learn; then
     they will be prisoners of one supplier, who will charge a
     monopolistic price.

   * Large companies have an unfair advantage wherever lawsuits become
     commonplace.  Since they can afford to sue, they can intimidate
     smaller developers with threats even when they don't really have a
     case.

   * Interface improvements will come slower, since incremental
     evolution through creative partial imitation will no longer occur.

   If interface monopolies are accepted, other large companies are
waiting to grab theirs:

   * Adobe is expected to claim a monopoly on the interfaces of various
     popular application programs, if Borland's appeal against Lotus
     fails.

   * Open Computing magazine reported a Microsoft vice president as
     threatening to sue people who copy the interface of Windows.

   Users invest a great deal of time and money in learning to use
computer interfaces.  Far more, in fact, than software developers
invest in developing *and even implementing* the interfaces.  Whoever
can own an interface, has made its users into captives, and
misappropriated their investment.

   To protect our freedom from monopolies like these, a group of
programmers and users have formed a grass-roots political organization,
the League for Programming Freedom.

   The purpose of the League is to oppose monopolistic practices such as
interface copyright and software patents.  The League calls for a return
to the legal policies of the recent past, in which programmers could
program freely.  The League is not concerned with free software as an
issue, and is not affiliated with the Free Software Foundation.

   The League's activities include publicizing the issue, as is being
done here, and filing friend-of-the-court briefs on behalf of
defendants sued by monopolists.  Recently the League filed a
friend-of-the-court brief for Borland in its appeal against Lotus.

   The League's membership rolls include John McCarthy, inventor of
Lisp, Marvin Minsky, founder of the MIT Artificial Intelligence lab,
Guy L.  Steele, Jr., author of well-known books on Lisp and C, as well
as Richard Stallman, the developer of GNU CC.  Please join and add your
name to the list.  Membership dues in the League are $42 per year for
programmers, managers and professionals; $10.50 for students; $21 for
others.

   Activist members are especially important, but members who have no
time to give are also important.  Surveys at major ACM conferences have
indicated a vast majority of attendees agree with the League.  If just
ten percent of the programmers who agree with the League join the
League, we will probably triumph.

   To join, or for more information, phone (617) 243-4091 or write to:

   You can also send electronic mail to `lpf@uunet.uu.net'.

   In addition to joining the League, here are some suggestions from the
League for other things you can do to protect your freedom to write
programs:

   * Tell your friends and colleagues about this issue and how it
     threatens to ruin the computer industry.

   * Mention that you are a League member in your `.signature', and
     mention the League's email address for inquiries.

   * Ask the companies you consider working for or working with to make
     statements against software monopolies, and give preference to
     those that do.

   * When employers ask you to sign contracts giving them copyright or
     patent rights, insist on clauses saying they can use these rights
     only defensively.  Don't rely on "company policy," since that can
     change at any time; don't rely on an individual executive's
     private word, since that person may be replaced.  Get a commitment
     just as binding as the commitment they get from you.

   * Write to Congress to explain the importance of this issue.

          House Subcommittee on Intellectual Property
          2137 Rayburn Bldg
          Washington, DC 20515

          Senate Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks and Copyrights
          United States Senate
          Washington, DC 20510

     (These committees have received lots of mail already; let's give
     them even more.)

   Democracy means nothing if you don't use it.  Stand up and be
counted!




Compile C, C++, or Objective C
******************************

   The C, C++, and Objective C versions of the compiler are integrated;
the GNU C compiler can compile programs written in C, C++, or Objective
C.

   "GCC" is a common shorthand term for the GNU C compiler.  This is
both the most general name for the compiler, and the name used when the
emphasis is on compiling C programs.

   When referring to C++ compilation, it is usual to call the compiler
"G++".  Since there is only one compiler, it is also accurate to call
it "GCC" no matter what the language context; however, the term "G++"
is more useful when the emphasis is on compiling C++ programs.

   We use the name "GNU CC" to refer to the compilation system as a
whole, and more specifically to the language-independent part of the
compiler.  For example, we refer to the optimization options as
affecting the behavior of "GNU CC" or sometimes just "the compiler".

   Front ends for other languages, such as Ada 9X, Fortran, Modula-3,
and Pascal, are under development.  These front-ends, like that for
C++, are built in subdirectories of GNU CC and link to it.  The result
is an integrated compiler that can compile programs written in C, C++,
Objective C, or any of the languages for which you have installed front
ends.

   In this manual, we only discuss the options for the C, Objective-C,
and C++ compilers and those of the GNU CC core.  Consult the
documentation of the other front ends for the options to use when
compiling programs written in other languages.

   G++ is a *compiler*, not merely a preprocessor.  G++ builds object
code directly from your C++ program source.  There is no intermediate C
version of the program.  (By contrast, for example, some other
implementations use a program that generates a C program from your C++
source.)  Avoiding an intermediate C representation of the program means
that you get better object code, and better debugging information.  The
GNU debugger, GDB, works with this information in the object code to
give you comprehensive C++ source-level editing capabilities (*note C
and C++: (gdb.info)C.).




GNU CC Command Options
**********************

   When you invoke GNU CC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the `-c' option says
not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files output
by the assembler.

   Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.

   Most of the command line options that you can use with GNU CC are
useful for C programs; when an option is only useful with another
language (usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the
description for a particular option does not mention a source language,
you can use that option with all supported languages.

   *Note Compiling C++ Programs: Invoking G++, for a summary of special
options for compiling C++ programs.

   The `gcc' program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multiletter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may *not* be grouped: `-dr' is very different from `-d -r'.

   You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the
order you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several
options of the same kind; for example, if you specify `-L' more than
once, the directories are searched in the order specified.

   Many options have long names starting with `-f' or with `-W'--for
example, `-fforce-mem', `-fstrength-reduce', `-Wformat' and so on.
Most of these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
of `-ffoo' would be `-fno-foo'.  This manual documents only one of
these two forms, whichever one is not the default.



Problems Compiling Certain Programs
===================================

   Certain programs have problems compiling.

   * Parse errors may occur compiling X11 on a Decstation running
     Ultrix 4.2 because of problems in DEC's versions of the X11 header
     files `X11/Xlib.h' and `X11/Xutil.h'.  People recommend adding
     `-I/usr/include/mit' to use the MIT versions of the header files,
     using the `-traditional' switch to turn off ANSI C, or fixing the
     header files by adding this:

          #ifdef __STDC__
          #define NeedFunctionPrototypes 0
          #endif

   * If you have trouble compiling Perl on a SunOS 4 system, it may be
     because Perl specifies `-I/usr/ucbinclude'.  This accesses the
     unfixed header files.  Perl specifies the options

          -traditional -Dvolatile=__volatile__
          -I/usr/include/sun -I/usr/ucbinclude
          -fpcc-struct-return

     most of which are unnecessary with GCC 2.4.5 and newer versions.
     You can make a properly working Perl by setting `ccflags' to
     `-fwritable-strings' (implied by the `-traditional' in the
     original options) and `cppflags' to empty in `config.sh', then
     typing `./doSH; make depend; make'.

   * On various 386 Unix systems derived from System V, including SCO,
     ISC, and ESIX, you may get error messages about running out of
     virtual memory while compiling certain programs.

     You can prevent this problem by linking GNU CC with the GNU malloc
     (which thus replaces the malloc that comes with the system).  GNU
     malloc is available as a separate package, and also in the file
     `src/gmalloc.c' in the GNU Emacs 19 distribution.

     If you have installed GNU malloc as a separate library package,
     use this option when you relink GNU CC:

          MALLOC=/usr/local/lib/libgmalloc.a

     Alternatively, if you have compiled `gmalloc.c' from Emacs 19, copy
     the object file to `gmalloc.o' and use this option when you relink
     GNU CC:

          MALLOC=gmalloc.o




Incompatibilities of GNU CC
===========================

   There are several noteworthy incompatibilities between GNU C and most
existing (non-ANSI) versions of C.  The `-traditional' option
eliminates many of these incompatibilities, *but not all*, by telling
GNU C to behave like the other C compilers.

   * GNU CC normally makes string constants read-only.  If several
     identical-looking string constants are used, GNU CC stores only one
     copy of the string.

     One consequence is that you cannot call `mktemp' with a string
     constant argument.  The function `mktemp' always alters the string
     its argument points to.

     Another consequence is that `sscanf' does not work on some systems
     when passed a string constant as its format control string or
     input.  This is because `sscanf' incorrectly tries to write into
     the string constant.  Likewise `fscanf' and `scanf'.

     The best solution to these problems is to change the program to use
     `char'-array variables with initialization strings for these
     purposes instead of string constants.  But if this is not possible,
     you can use the `-fwritable-strings' flag, which directs GNU CC to
     handle string constants the same way most C compilers do.
     `-traditional' also has this effect, among others.

   * `-2147483648' is positive.

     This is because 2147483648 cannot fit in the type `int', so
     (following the ANSI C rules) its data type is `unsigned long int'.
     Negating this value yields 2147483648 again.

   * GNU CC does not substitute macro arguments when they appear inside
     of string constants.  For example, the following macro in GNU CC

          #define foo(a) "a"

     will produce output `"a"' regardless of what the argument A is.

     The `-traditional' option directs GNU CC to handle such cases
     (among others) in the old-fashioned (non-ANSI) fashion.

   * When you use `setjmp' and `longjmp', the only automatic variables
     guaranteed to remain valid are those declared `volatile'.  This is
     a consequence of automatic register allocation.  Consider this
     function:

          jmp_buf j;

          foo ()
          {
            int a, b;

            a = fun1 ();
            if (setjmp (j))
              return a;

            a = fun2 ();
            /* `longjmp (j)' may occur in `fun3'. */
            return a + fun3 ();
          }

     Here `a' may or may not be restored to its first value when the
     `longjmp' occurs.  If `a' is allocated in a register, then its
     first value is restored; otherwise, it keeps the last value stored
     in it.

     If you use the `-W' option with the `-O' option, you will get a
     warning when GNU CC thinks such a problem might be possible.

     The `-traditional' option directs GNU C to put variables in the
     stack by default, rather than in registers, in functions that call
     `setjmp'.  This results in the behavior found in traditional C
     compilers.

   * Programs that use preprocessor directives in the middle of macro
     arguments do not work with GNU CC.  For example, a program like
     this will not work:

          foobar (
          #define luser
                  hack)

     ANSI C does not permit such a construct.  It would make sense to
     support it when `-traditional' is used, but it is too much work to
     implement.

   * Declarations of external variables and functions within a block
     apply only to the block containing the declaration.  In other
     words, they have the same scope as any other declaration in the
     same place.

     In some other C compilers, a `extern' declaration affects all the
     rest of the file even if it happens within a block.

     The `-traditional' option directs GNU C to treat all `extern'
     declarations as global, like traditional compilers.

   * In traditional C, you can combine `long', etc., with a typedef
     name, as shown here:

          typedef int foo;
          typedef long foo bar;

     In ANSI C, this is not allowed: `long' and other type modifiers
     require an explicit `int'.  Because this criterion is expressed by
     Bison grammar rules rather than C code, the `-traditional' flag
     cannot alter it.

   * PCC allows typedef names to be used as function parameters.  The
     difficulty described immediately above applies here too.

   * PCC allows whitespace in the middle of compound assignment
     operators such as `+='.  GNU CC, following the ANSI standard, does
     not allow this.  The difficulty described immediately above
     applies here too.

   * GNU CC complains about unterminated character constants inside of
     preprocessor conditionals that fail.  Some programs have English
     comments enclosed in conditionals that are guaranteed to fail; if
     these comments contain apostrophes, GNU CC will probably report an
     error.  For example, this code would produce an error:

          #if 0
          You can't expect this to work.
          #endif

     The best solution to such a problem is to put the text into an
     actual C comment delimited by `/*...*/'.  However, `-traditional'
     suppresses these error messages.

   * Many user programs contain the declaration `long time ();'.  In the
     past, the system header files on many systems did not actually
     declare `time', so it did not matter what type your program
     declared it to return.  But in systems with ANSI C headers, `time'
     is declared to return `time_t', and if that is not the same as
     `long', then `long time ();' is erroneous.

     The solution is to change your program to use `time_t' as the
     return type of `time'.

   * When compiling functions that return `float', PCC converts it to a
     double.  GNU CC actually returns a `float'.  If you are concerned
     with PCC compatibility, you should declare your functions to return
     `double'; you might as well say what you mean.

   * When compiling functions that return structures or unions, GNU CC
     output code normally uses a method different from that used on most
     versions of Unix.  As a result, code compiled with GNU CC cannot
     call a structure-returning function compiled with PCC, and vice
     versa.

     The method used by GNU CC is as follows: a structure or union
     which is 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes long is returned like a scalar.  A
     structure or union with any other size is stored into an address
     supplied by the caller (usually in a special, fixed register, but
     on some machines it is passed on the stack).  The
     machine-description macros `STRUCT_VALUE' and
     `STRUCT_INCOMING_VALUE' tell GNU CC where to pass this address.

     By contrast, PCC on most target machines returns structures and
     unions of any size by copying the data into an area of static
     storage, and then returning the address of that storage as if it
     were a pointer value.  The caller must copy the data from that
     memory area to the place where the value is wanted.  GNU CC does
     not use this method because it is slower and nonreentrant.

     On some newer machines, PCC uses a reentrant convention for all
     structure and union returning.  GNU CC on most of these machines
     uses a compatible convention when returning structures and unions
     in memory, but still returns small structures and unions in
     registers.

     You can tell GNU CC to use a compatible convention for all
     structure and union returning with the option
     `-fpcc-struct-return'.

   * GNU C complains about program fragments such as `0x74ae-0x4000'
     which appear to be two hexadecimal constants separated by the minus
     operator.  Actually, this string is a single "preprocessing token".
     Each such token must correspond to one token in C.  Since this
     does not, GNU C prints an error message.  Although it may appear
     obvious that what is meant is an operator and two values, the ANSI
     C standard specifically requires that this be treated as erroneous.

     A "preprocessing token" is a "preprocessing number" if it begins
     with a digit and is followed by letters, underscores, digits,
     periods and `e+', `e-', `E+', or `E-' character sequences.

     To make the above program fragment valid, place whitespace in
     front of the minus sign.  This whitespace will end the
     preprocessing number.




Fixed Header Files
==================

   GNU CC needs to install corrected versions of some system header
files.  This is because most target systems have some header files that
won't work with GNU CC unless they are changed.  Some have bugs, some
are incompatible with ANSI C, and some depend on special features of
other compilers.

   Installing GNU CC automatically creates and installs the fixed header
files, by running a program called `fixincludes' (or for certain
targets an alternative such as `fixinc.svr4').  Normally, you don't
need to pay attention to this.  But there are cases where it doesn't do
the right thing automatically.

   * If you update the system's header files, such as by installing a
     new system version, the fixed header files of GNU CC are not
     automatically updated.  The easiest way to update them is to
     reinstall GNU CC.  (If you want to be clever, look in the makefile
     and you can find a shortcut.)

   * On some systems, in particular SunOS 4, header file directories
     contain machine-specific symbolic links in certain places.  This
     makes it possible to share most of the header files among hosts
     running the same version of SunOS 4 on different machine models.

     The programs that fix the header files do not understand this
     special way of using symbolic links; therefore, the directory of
     fixed header files is good only for the machine model used to
     build it.

     In SunOS 4, only programs that look inside the kernel will notice
     the difference between machine models.  Therefore, for most
     purposes, you need not be concerned about this.

     It is possible to make separate sets of fixed header files for the
     different machine models, and arrange a structure of symbolic
     links so as to use the proper set, but you'll have to do this by
     hand.

   * On Lynxos, GNU CC by default does not fix the header files.  This
     is because bugs in the shell cause the `fixincludes' script to
     fail.

     This means you will encounter problems due to bugs in the system
     header files.  It may be no comfort that they aren't GNU CC's
     fault, but it does mean that there's nothing for us to do about
     them.




Disappointments and Misunderstandings
=====================================

   These problems are perhaps regrettable, but we don't know any
practical way around them.

   * Certain local variables aren't recognized by debuggers when you
     compile with optimization.

     This occurs because sometimes GNU CC optimizes the variable out of
     existence.  There is no way to tell the debugger how to compute the
     value such a variable "would have had", and it is not clear that
     would be desirable anyway.  So GNU CC simply does not mention the
     eliminated variable when it writes debugging information.

     You have to expect a certain amount of disagreement between the
     executable and your source code, when you use optimization.

   * Users often think it is a bug when GNU CC reports an error for code
     like this:

          int foo (struct mumble *);

          struct mumble { ... };

          int foo (struct mumble *x)
          { ... }

     This code really is erroneous, because the scope of `struct
     mumble' in the prototype is limited to the argument list
     containing it.  It does not refer to the `struct mumble' defined
     with file scope immediately below--they are two unrelated types
     with similar names in different scopes.

     But in the definition of `foo', the file-scope type is used
     because that is available to be inherited.  Thus, the definition
     and the prototype do not match, and you get an error.

     This behavior may seem silly, but it's what the ANSI standard
     specifies.  It is easy enough for you to make your code work by
     moving the definition of `struct mumble' above the prototype.
     It's not worth being incompatible with ANSI C just to avoid an
     error for the example shown above.

   * Accesses to bitfields even in volatile objects works by accessing
     larger objects, such as a byte or a word.  You cannot rely on what
     size of object is accessed in order to read or write the bitfield;
     it may even vary for a given bitfield according to the precise
     usage.

     If you care about controlling the amount of memory that is
     accessed, use volatile but do not use bitfields.

   * GNU CC comes with shell scripts to fix certain known problems in
     system header files.  They install corrected copies of various
     header files in a special directory where only GNU CC will
     normally look for them.  The scripts adapt to various systems by
     searching all the system header files for the problem cases that
     we know about.

     If new system header files are installed, nothing automatically
     arranges to update the corrected header files.  You will have to
     reinstall GNU CC to fix the new header files.  More specifically,
     go to the build directory and delete the files `stmp-fixinc' and
     `stmp-headers', and the subdirectory `include'; then do `make
     install' again.

   * On 68000 systems, you can get paradoxical results if you test the
     precise values of floating point numbers.  For example, you can
     find that a floating point value which is not a NaN is not equal
     to itself.  This results from the fact that the the floating point
     registers hold a few more bits of precision than fit in a `double'
     in memory.  Compiled code moves values between memory and floating
     point registers at its convenience, and moving them into memory
     truncates them.

     You can partially avoid this problem by using the `-ffloat-store'
     option (*note Optimize Options::.).

   * On the MIPS, variable argument functions using `varargs.h' cannot
     have a floating point value for the first argument.  The reason
     for this is that in the absence of a prototype in scope, if the
     first argument is a floating point, it is passed in a floating
     point register, rather than an integer register.

     If the code is rewritten to use the ANSI standard `stdarg.h'
     method of variable arguments, and the prototype is in scope at the
     time of the call, everything will work fine.




Common Misunderstandings with GNU C++
=====================================

   C++ is a complex language and an evolving one, and its standard
definition (the ANSI C++ draft standard) is also evolving.  As a result,
your C++ compiler may occasionally surprise you, even when its behavior
is correct.  This section discusses some areas that frequently give
rise to questions of this sort.


Declare *and* Define Static Members
-----------------------------------

   When a class has static data members, it is not enough to *declare*
the static member; you must also *define* it.  For example:

     class Foo
     {
       ...
       void method();
       static int bar;
     };

   This declaration only establishes that the class `Foo' has an `int'
named `Foo::bar', and a member function named `Foo::method'.  But you
still need to define *both* `method' and `bar' elsewhere.  According to
the draft ANSI standard, you must supply an initializer in one (and
only one) source file, such as:

     int Foo::bar = 0;

   Other C++ compilers may not correctly implement the standard
behavior.  As a result, when you switch to `g++' from one of these
compilers, you may discover that a program that appeared to work
correctly in fact does not conform to the standard: `g++' reports as
undefined symbols any static data members that lack definitions.




Temporaries May Vanish Before You Expect
----------------------------------------

   It is dangerous to use pointers or references to *portions* of a
temporary object.  The compiler may very well delete the object before
you expect it to, leaving a pointer to garbage.  The most common place
where this problem crops up is in classes like the libg++ `String'
class, that define a conversion function to type `char *' or `const
char *'.  However, any class that returns a pointer to some internal
structure is potentially subject to this problem.

   For example, a program may use a function `strfunc' that returns
`String' objects, and another function `charfunc' that operates on
pointers to `char':

     String strfunc ();
     void charfunc (const char *);

In this situation, it may seem natural to write
`charfunc (strfunc ());' based on the knowledge that class `String' has
an explicit conversion to `char' pointers.  However, what really
happens is akin to `charfunc (strfunc ().convert ());', where the
`convert' method is a function to do the same data conversion normally
performed by a cast.  Since the last use of the temporary `String'
object is the call to the conversion function, the compiler may delete
that object before actually calling `charfunc'.  The compiler has no
way of knowing that deleting the `String' object will invalidate the
pointer.  The pointer then points to garbage, so that by the time
`charfunc' is called, it gets an invalid argument.

   Code like this may run successfully under some other compilers,
especially those that delete temporaries relatively late.  However, the
GNU C++ behavior is also standard-conformant, so if your program depends
on late destruction of temporaries it is not portable.

   If you think this is surprising, you should be aware that the ANSI
C++ committee continues to debate the lifetime-of-temporaries problem.

   For now, at least, the safe way to write such code is to give the
temporary a name, which forces it to remain until the end of the scope
of the name.  For example:

     String& tmp = strfunc ();
     charfunc (tmp);




Caveats of using `protoize'
===========================

   The conversion programs `protoize' and `unprotoize' can sometimes
change a source file in a way that won't work unless you rearrange it.

   * `protoize' can insert references to a type name or type tag before
     the definition, or in a file where they are not defined.

     If this happens, compiler error messages should show you where the
     new references are, so fixing the file by hand is straightforward.

   * There are some C constructs which `protoize' cannot figure out.
     For example, it can't determine argument types for declaring a
     pointer-to-function variable; this you must do by hand.  `protoize'
     inserts a comment containing `???' each time it finds such a
     variable; so you can find all such variables by searching for this
     string.  ANSI C does not require declaring the argument types of
     pointer-to-function types.

   * Using `unprotoize' can easily introduce bugs.  If the program
     relied on prototypes to bring about conversion of arguments, these
     conversions will not take place in the program without prototypes.
     One case in which you can be sure `unprotoize' is safe is when you
     are removing prototypes that were made with `protoize'; if the
     program worked before without any prototypes, it will work again
     without them.

     You can find all the places where this problem might occur by
     compiling the program with the `-Wconversion' option.  It prints a
     warning whenever an argument is converted.

   * Both conversion programs can be confused if there are macro calls
     in and around the text to be converted.  In other words, the
     standard syntax for a declaration or definition must not result
     from expanding a macro.  This problem is inherent in the design of
     C and cannot be fixed.  If only a few functions have confusing
     macro calls, you can easily convert them manually.

   * `protoize' cannot get the argument types for a function whose
     definition was not actually compiled due to preprocessor
     conditionals.  When this happens, `protoize' changes nothing in
     regard to such a function.  `protoize' tries to detect such
     instances and warn about them.

     You can generally work around this problem by using `protoize' step
     by step, each time specifying a different set of `-D' options for
     compilation, until all of the functions have been converted.
     There is no automatic way to verify that you have got them all,
     however.

   * Confusion may result if there is an occasion to convert a function
     declaration or definition in a region of source code where there
     is more than one formal parameter list present.  Thus, attempts to
     convert code containing multiple (conditionally compiled) versions
     of a single function header (in the same vicinity) may not produce
     the desired (or expected) results.

     If you plan on converting source files which contain such code, it
     is recommended that you first make sure that each conditionally
     compiled region of source code which contains an alternative
     function header also contains at least one additional follower
     token (past the final right parenthesis of the function header).
     This should circumvent the problem.

   * `unprotoize' can become confused when trying to convert a function
     definition or declaration which contains a declaration for a
     pointer-to-function formal argument which has the same name as the
     function being defined or declared.  We recommand you avoid such
     choices of formal parameter names.

   * You might also want to correct some of the indentation by hand and
     break long lines.  (The conversion programs don't write lines
     longer than eighty characters in any case.)




Certain Changes We Don't Want to Make
=====================================

   This section lists changes that people frequently request, but which
we do not make because we think GNU CC is better without them.

   * Checking the number and type of arguments to a function which has
     an old-fashioned definition and no prototype.

     Such a feature would work only occasionally--only for calls that
     appear in the same file as the called function, following the
     definition.  The only way to check all calls reliably is to add a
     prototype for the function.  But adding a prototype eliminates the
     motivation for this feature.  So the feature is not worthwhile.

   * Warning about using an expression whose type is signed as a shift
     count.

     Shift count operands are probably signed more often than unsigned.
     Warning about this would cause far more annoyance than good.

   * Warning about assigning a signed value to an unsigned variable.

     Such assignments must be very common; warning about them would
     cause more annoyance than good.

   * Warning about unreachable code.

     It's very common to have unreachable code in machine-generated
     programs.  For example, this happens normally in some files of GNU
     C itself.

   * Warning when a non-void function value is ignored.

     Coming as I do from a Lisp background, I balk at the idea that
     there is something dangerous about discarding a value.  There are
     functions that return values which some callers may find useful;
     it makes no sense to clutter the program with a cast to `void'
     whenever the value isn't useful.

   * Assuming (for optimization) that the address of an external symbol
     is never zero.

     This assumption is false on certain systems when `#pragma weak' is
     used.

   * Making `-fshort-enums' the default.

     This would cause storage layout to be incompatible with most other
     C compilers.  And it doesn't seem very important, given that you
     can get the same result in other ways.  The case where it matters
     most is when the enumeration-valued object is inside a structure,
     and in that case you can specify a field width explicitly.

   * Making bitfields unsigned by default on particular machines where
     "the ABI standard" says to do so.

     The ANSI C standard leaves it up to the implementation whether a
     bitfield declared plain `int' is signed or not.  This in effect
     creates two alternative dialects of C.

     The GNU C compiler supports both dialects; you can specify the
     signed dialect with `-fsigned-bitfields' and the unsigned dialect
     with `-funsigned-bitfields'.  However, this leaves open the
     question of which dialect to use by default.

     Currently, the preferred dialect makes plain bitfields signed,
     because this is simplest.  Since `int' is the same as `signed int'
     in every other context, it is cleanest for them to be the same in
     bitfields as well.

     Some computer manufacturers have published Application Binary
     Interface standards which specify that plain bitfields should be
     unsigned.  It is a mistake, however, to say anything about this
     issue in an ABI.  This is because the handling of plain bitfields
     distinguishes two dialects of C.  Both dialects are meaningful on
     every type of machine.  Whether a particular object file was
     compiled using signed bitfields or unsigned is of no concern to
     other object files, even if they access the same bitfields in the
     same data structures.

     A given program is written in one or the other of these two
     dialects.  The program stands a chance to work on most any machine
     if it is compiled with the proper dialect.  It is unlikely to work
     at all if compiled with the wrong dialect.

     Many users appreciate the GNU C compiler because it provides an
     environment that is uniform across machines.  These users would be
     inconvenienced if the compiler treated plain bitfields differently
     on certain machines.

     Occasionally users write programs intended only for a particular
     machine type.  On these occasions, the users would benefit if the
     GNU C compiler were to support by default the same dialect as the
     other compilers on that machine.  But such applications are rare.
     And users writing a program to run on more than one type of
     machine cannot possibly benefit from this kind of compatibility.

     This is why GNU CC does and will treat plain bitfields in the same
     fashion on all types of machines (by default).

     There are some arguments for making bitfields unsigned by default
     on all machines.  If, for example, this becomes a universal de
     facto standard, it would make sense for GNU CC to go along with
     it.  This is something to be considered in the future.

     (Of course, users strongly concerned about portability should
     indicate explicitly in each bitfield whether it is signed or not.
     In this way, they write programs which have the same meaning in
     both C dialects.)

   * Undefining `__STDC__' when `-ansi' is not used.

     Currently, GNU CC defines `__STDC__' as long as you don't use
     `-traditional'.  This provides good results in practice.

     Programmers normally use conditionals on `__STDC__' to ask whether
     it is safe to use certain features of ANSI C, such as function
     prototypes or ANSI token concatenation.  Since plain `gcc' supports
     all the features of ANSI C, the correct answer to these questions
     is "yes".

     Some users try to use `__STDC__' to check for the availability of
     certain library facilities.  This is actually incorrect usage in
     an ANSI C program, because the ANSI C standard says that a
     conforming freestanding implementation should define `__STDC__'
     even though it does not have the library facilities.  `gcc -ansi
     -pedantic' is a conforming freestanding implementation, and it is
     therefore required to define `__STDC__', even though it does not
     come with an ANSI C library.

     Sometimes people say that defining `__STDC__' in a compiler that
     does not completely conform to the ANSI C standard somehow
     violates the standard.  This is illogical.  The standard is a
     standard for compilers that claim to support ANSI C, such as `gcc
     -ansi'--not for other compilers such as plain `gcc'.  Whatever the
     ANSI C standard says is relevant to the design of plain `gcc'
     without `-ansi' only for pragmatic reasons, not as a requirement.

   * Undefining `__STDC__' in C++.

     Programs written to compile with C++-to-C translators get the
     value of `__STDC__' that goes with the C compiler that is
     subsequently used.  These programs must test `__STDC__' to
     determine what kind of C preprocessor that compiler uses: whether
     they should concatenate tokens in the ANSI C fashion or in the
     traditional fashion.

     These programs work properly with GNU C++ if `__STDC__' is defined.
     They would not work otherwise.

     In addition, many header files are written to provide prototypes
     in ANSI C but not in traditional C.  Many of these header files
     can work without change in C++ provided `__STDC__' is defined.  If
     `__STDC__' is not defined, they will all fail, and will all need
     to be changed to test explicitly for C++ as well.

   * Deleting "empty" loops.

     GNU CC does not delete "empty" loops because the most likely reason
     you would put one in a program is to have a delay.  Deleting them
     will not make real programs run any faster, so it would be
     pointless.

     It would be different if optimization of a nonempty loop could
     produce an empty one.  But this generally can't happen.

   * Making side effects happen in the same order as in some other
     compiler.

     It is never safe to depend on the order of evaluation of side
     effects.  For example, a function call like this may very well
     behave differently from one compiler to another:

          void func (int, int);

          int i = 2;
          func (i++, i++);

     There is no guarantee (in either the C or the C++ standard language
     definitions) that the increments will be evaluated in any
     particular order.  Either increment might happen first.  `func'
     might get the arguments `3, 4', or it might get `4, 3', or even
     `3, 3'.

   * Not allowing structures with volatile fields in registers.

     Strictly speaking, there is no prohibition in the ANSI C standard
     against allowing structures with volatile fields in registers, but
     it does not seem to make any sense and is probably not what you
     wanted to do.  So the compiler will give an error message in this
     case.




Warning Messages and Error Messages
===================================

   The GNU compiler can produce two kinds of diagnostics: errors and
warnings.  Each kind has a different purpose:

     *Errors* report problems that make it impossible to compile your
     program.  GNU CC reports errors with the source file name and line
     number where the problem is apparent.

     *Warnings* report other unusual conditions in your code that *may*
     indicate a problem, although compilation can (and does) proceed.
     Warning messages also report the source file name and line number,
     but include the text `warning:' to distinguish them from error
     messages.

   Warnings may indicate danger points where you should check to make
sure that your program really does what you intend; or the use of
obsolete features; or the use of nonstandard features of GNU C or C++.
Many warnings are issued only if you ask for them, with one of the `-W'
options (for instance, `-Wall' requests a variety of useful warnings).

   GNU CC always tries to compile your program if possible; it never
gratuituously rejects a program whose meaning is clear merely because
(for instance) it fails to conform to a standard.  In some cases,
however, the C and C++ standards specify that certain extensions are
forbidden, and a diagnostic *must* be issued by a conforming compiler.
The `-pedantic' option tells GNU CC to issue warnings in such cases;
`-pedantic-errors' says to make them errors instead.  This does not
mean that *all* non-ANSI constructs get warnings or errors.

   *Note Options to Request or Suppress Warnings: Warning Options, for
more detail on these and related command-line options.




Passes and Files of the Compiler
********************************

   The overall control structure of the compiler is in `toplev.c'.  This
file is responsible for initialization, decoding arguments, opening and
closing files, and sequencing the passes.

   The parsing pass is invoked only once, to parse the entire input.
The RTL intermediate code for a function is generated as the function
is parsed, a statement at a time.  Each statement is read in as a
syntax tree and then converted to RTL; then the storage for the tree
for the statement is reclaimed.  Storage for types (and the expressions
for their sizes), declarations, and a representation of the binding
contours and how they nest, remain until the function is finished being
compiled; these are all needed to output the debugging information.

   Each time the parsing pass reads a complete function definition or
top-level declaration, it calls either the function
`rest_of_compilation', or the function `rest_of_decl_compilation' in
`toplev.c', which are responsible for all further processing necessary,
ending with output of the assembler language.  All other compiler
passes run, in sequence, within `rest_of_compilation'.  When that
function returns from compiling a function definition, the storage used
for that function definition's compilation is entirely freed, unless it
is an inline function (*note An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro:
Inline.).

   Here is a list of all the passes of the compiler and their source
files.  Also included is a description of where debugging dumps can be
requested with `-d' options.

   * Parsing.  This pass reads the entire text of a function definition,
     constructing partial syntax trees.  This and RTL generation are no
     longer truly separate passes (formerly they were), but it is
     easier to think of them as separate.

     The tree representation does not entirely follow C syntax, because
     it is intended to support other languages as well.

     Language-specific data type analysis is also done in this pass,
     and every tree node that represents an expression has a data type
     attached.  Variables are represented as declaration nodes.

     Constant folding and some arithmetic simplifications are also done
     during this pass.

     The language-independent source files for parsing are
     `stor-layout.c', `fold-const.c', and `tree.c'.  There are also
     header files `tree.h' and `tree.def' which define the format of
     the tree representation.

     The source files to parse C are `c-parse.in', `c-decl.c',
     `c-typeck.c', `c-aux-info.c', `c-convert.c', and `c-lang.c' along
     with header files `c-lex.h', and `c-tree.h'.

     The source files for parsing C++ are `cp-parse.y', `cp-class.c',
     `cp-cvt.c', `cp-decl.c', `cp-decl2.c', `cp-dem.c', `cp-except.c',
     `cp-expr.c', `cp-init.c', `cp-lex.c', `cp-method.c', `cp-ptree.c',
     `cp-search.c', `cp-tree.c', `cp-type2.c', and `cp-typeck.c', along
     with header files `cp-tree.def', `cp-tree.h', and `cp-decl.h'.

     The special source files for parsing Objective C are
     `objc-parse.y', `objc-actions.c', `objc-tree.def', and
     `objc-actions.h'.  Certain C-specific files are used for this as
     well.

     The file `c-common.c' is also used for all of the above languages.

   * RTL generation.  This is the conversion of syntax tree into RTL
     code.  It is actually done statement-by-statement during parsing,
     but for most purposes it can be thought of as a separate pass.

     This is where the bulk of target-parameter-dependent code is found,
     since often it is necessary for strategies to apply only when
     certain standard kinds of instructions are available.  The purpose
     of named instruction patterns is to provide this information to
     the RTL generation pass.

     Optimization is done in this pass for `if'-conditions that are
     comparisons, boolean operations or conditional expressions.  Tail
     recursion is detected at this time also.  Decisions are made about
     how best to arrange loops and how to output `switch' statements.

     The source files for RTL generation include `stmt.c', `calls.c',
     `expr.c', `explow.c', `expmed.c', `function.c', `optabs.c' and
     `emit-rtl.c'.  Also, the file `insn-emit.c', generated from the
     machine description by the program `genemit', is used in this
     pass.  The header file `expr.h' is used for communication within
     this pass.

     The header files `insn-flags.h' and `insn-codes.h', generated from
     the machine description by the programs `genflags' and `gencodes',
     tell this pass which standard names are available for use and
     which patterns correspond to them.

     Aside from debugging information output, none of the following
     passes refers to the tree structure representation of the function
     (only part of which is saved).

     The decision of whether the function can and should be expanded
     inline in its subsequent callers is made at the end of rtl
     generation.  The function must meet certain criteria, currently
     related to the size of the function and the types and number of
     parameters it has.  Note that this function may contain loops,
     recursive calls to itself (tail-recursive functions can be
     inlined!), gotos, in short, all constructs supported by GNU CC.
     The file `integrate.c' contains the code to save a function's rtl
     for later inlining and to inline that rtl when the function is
     called.  The header file `integrate.h' is also used for this
     purpose.

     The option `-dr' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.rtl' to
     the input file name.

   * Jump optimization.  This pass simplifies jumps to the following
     instruction, jumps across jumps, and jumps to jumps.  It deletes
     unreferenced labels and unreachable code, except that unreachable
     code that contains a loop is not recognized as unreachable in this
     pass.  (Such loops are deleted later in the basic block analysis.)
     It also converts some code originally written with jumps into
     sequences of instructions that directly set values from the
     results of comparisons, if the machine has such instructions.

     Jump optimization is performed two or three times.  The first time
     is immediately following RTL generation.  The second time is after
     CSE, but only if CSE says repeated jump optimization is needed.
     The last time is right before the final pass.  That time,
     cross-jumping and deletion of no-op move instructions are done
     together with the optimizations described above.

     The source file of this pass is `jump.c'.

     The option `-dj' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass is run for the first time.  This dump file's name is
     made by appending `.jump' to the input file name.

   * Register scan.  This pass finds the first and last use of each
     register, as a guide for common subexpression elimination.  Its
     source is in `regclass.c'.

   * Jump threading.  This pass detects a condition jump that branches
     to an identical or inverse test.  Such jumps can be `threaded'
     through the second conditional test.  The source code for this
     pass is in `jump.c'.  This optimization is only performed if
     `-fthread-jumps' is enabled.

   * Common subexpression elimination.  This pass also does constant
     propagation.  Its source file is `cse.c'.  If constant propagation
     causes conditional jumps to become unconditional or to become
     no-ops, jump optimization is run again when CSE is finished.

     The option `-ds' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.cse' to
     the input file name.

   * Loop optimization.  This pass moves constant expressions out of
     loops, and optionally does strength-reduction and loop unrolling
     as well.  Its source files are `loop.c' and `unroll.c', plus the
     header `loop.h' used for communication between them.  Loop
     unrolling uses some functions in `integrate.c' and the header
     `integrate.h'.

     The option `-dL' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.loop' to
     the input file name.

   * If `-frerun-cse-after-loop' was enabled, a second common
     subexpression elimination pass is performed after the loop
     optimization pass.  Jump threading is also done again at this time
     if it was specified.

     The option `-dt' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.cse2' to
     the input file name.

   * Stupid register allocation is performed at this point in a
     nonoptimizing compilation.  It does a little data flow analysis as
     well.  When stupid register allocation is in use, the next pass
     executed is the reloading pass; the others in between are skipped.
     The source file is `stupid.c'.

   * Data flow analysis (`flow.c').  This pass divides the program into
     basic blocks (and in the process deletes unreachable loops); then
     it computes which pseudo-registers are live at each point in the
     program, and makes the first instruction that uses a value point at
     the instruction that computed the value.

     This pass also deletes computations whose results are never used,
     and combines memory references with add or subtract instructions
     to make autoincrement or autodecrement addressing.

     The option `-df' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.flow' to
     the input file name.  If stupid register allocation is in use, this
     dump file reflects the full results of such allocation.

   * Instruction combination (`combine.c').  This pass attempts to
     combine groups of two or three instructions that are related by
     data flow into single instructions.  It combines the RTL
     expressions for the instructions by substitution, simplifies the
     result using algebra, and then attempts to match the result
     against the machine description.

     The option `-dc' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.combine'
     to the input file name.

   * Instruction scheduling (`sched.c').  This pass looks for
     instructions whose output will not be available by the time that
     it is used in subsequent instructions.  (Memory loads and floating
     point instructions often have this behavior on RISC machines).  It
     re-orders instructions within a basic block to try to separate the
     definition and use of items that otherwise would cause pipeline
     stalls.

     Instruction scheduling is performed twice.  The first time is
     immediately after instruction combination and the second is
     immediately after reload.

     The option `-dS' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after this
     pass is run for the first time.  The dump file's name is made by
     appending `.sched' to the input file name.

   * Register class preferencing.  The RTL code is scanned to find out
     which register class is best for each pseudo register.  The source
     file is `regclass.c'.

   * Local register allocation (`local-alloc.c').  This pass allocates
     hard registers to pseudo registers that are used only within one
     basic block.  Because the basic block is linear, it can use fast
     and powerful techniques to do a very good job.

     The option `-dl' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.lreg' to
     the input file name.

   * Global register allocation (`global.c').  This pass allocates hard
     registers for the remaining pseudo registers (those whose life
     spans are not contained in one basic block).

   * Reloading.  This pass renumbers pseudo registers with the hardware
     registers numbers they were allocated.  Pseudo registers that did
     not get hard registers are replaced with stack slots.  Then it
     finds instructions that are invalid because a value has failed to
     end up in a register, or has ended up in a register of the wrong
     kind.  It fixes up these instructions by reloading the
     problematical values temporarily into registers.  Additional
     instructions are generated to do the copying.

     The reload pass also optionally eliminates the frame pointer and
     inserts instructions to save and restore call-clobbered registers
     around calls.

     Source files are `reload.c' and `reload1.c', plus the header
     `reload.h' used for communication between them.

     The option `-dg' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.greg' to
     the input file name.

   * Instruction scheduling is repeated here to try to avoid pipeline
     stalls due to memory loads generated for spilled pseudo registers.

     The option `-dR' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.sched2'
     to the input file name.

   * Jump optimization is repeated, this time including cross-jumping
     and deletion of no-op move instructions.

     The option `-dJ' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.jump2' to
     the input file name.

   * Delayed branch scheduling.  This optional pass attempts to find
     instructions that can go into the delay slots of other
     instructions, usually jumps and calls.  The source file name is
     `reorg.c'.

     The option `-dd' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.dbr' to
     the input file name.

   * Conversion from usage of some hard registers to usage of a register
     stack may be done at this point.  Currently, this is supported only
     for the floating-point registers of the Intel 80387 coprocessor.
     The source file name is `reg-stack.c'.

     The options `-dk' causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
     this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending `.stack' to
     the input file name.

   * Final.  This pass outputs the assembler code for the function.  It
     is also responsible for identifying spurious test and compare
     instructions.  Machine-specific peephole optimizations are
     performed at the same time.  The function entry and exit sequences
     are generated directly as assembler code in this pass; they never
     exist as RTL.

     The source files are `final.c' plus `insn-output.c'; the latter is
     generated automatically from the machine description by the tool
     `genoutput'.  The header file `conditions.h' is used for
     communication between these files.

   * Debugging information output.  This is run after final because it
     must output the stack slot offsets for pseudo registers that did
     not get hard registers.  Source files are `dbxout.c' for DBX
     symbol table format, `sdbout.c' for SDB symbol table format, and
     `dwarfout.c' for DWARF symbol table format.

   Some additional files are used by all or many passes:

   * Every pass uses `machmode.def' and `machmode.h' which define the
     machine modes.

   * Several passes use `real.h', which defines the default
     representation of floating point constants and how to operate on
     them.

   * All the passes that work with RTL use the header files `rtl.h' and
     `rtl.def', and subroutines in file `rtl.c'.  The tools `gen*' also
     use these files to read and work with the machine description RTL.

   * Several passes refer to the header file `insn-config.h' which
     contains a few parameters (C macro definitions) generated
     automatically from the machine description RTL by the tool
     `genconfig'.

   * Several passes use the instruction recognizer, which consists of
     `recog.c' and `recog.h', plus the files `insn-recog.c' and
     `insn-extract.c' that are generated automatically from the machine
     description by the tools `genrecog' and `genextract'.

   * Several passes use the header files `regs.h' which defines the
     information recorded about pseudo register usage, and
     `basic-block.h' which defines the information recorded about basic
     blocks.

   * `hard-reg-set.h' defines the type `HARD_REG_SET', a bit-vector
     with a bit for each hard register, and some macros to manipulate
     it.  This type is just `int' if the machine has few enough hard
     registers; otherwise it is an array of `int' and some of the
     macros expand into loops.

   * Several passes use instruction attributes.  A definition of the
     attributes defined for a particular machine is in file
     `insn-attr.h', which is generated from the machine description by
     the program `genattr'.  The file `insn-attrtab.c' contains
     subroutines to obtain the attribute values for insns.  It is
     generated from the machine description by the program `genattrtab'.




RTL Representation
******************

   Most of the work of the compiler is done on an intermediate
representation called register transfer language.  In this language,
the instructions to be output are described, pretty much one by one, in
an algebraic form that describes what the instruction does.

   RTL is inspired by Lisp lists.  It has both an internal form, made
up of structures that point at other structures, and a textual form
that is used in the machine description and in printed debugging dumps.
The textual form uses nested parentheses to indicate the pointers in
the internal form.


RTL Object Types
================

   RTL uses five kinds of objects: expressions, integers, wide integers,
strings and vectors.  Expressions are the most important ones.  An RTL
expression ("RTX", for short) is a C structure, but it is usually
referred to with a pointer; a type that is given the typedef name `rtx'.

   An integer is simply an `int'; their written form uses decimal
digits.  A wide integer is an integral object whose type is
`HOST_WIDE_INT' (*note Config::.); their written form uses decimal
digits.

   A string is a sequence of characters.  In core it is represented as a
`char *' in usual C fashion, and it is written in C syntax as well.
However, strings in RTL may never be null.  If you write an empty
string in a machine description, it is represented in core as a null
pointer rather than as a pointer to a null character.  In certain
contexts, these null pointers instead of strings are valid.  Within RTL
code, strings are most commonly found inside `symbol_ref' expressions,
but they appear in other contexts in the RTL expressions that make up
machine descriptions.

   A vector contains an arbitrary number of pointers to expressions.
The number of elements in the vector is explicitly present in the
vector.  The written form of a vector consists of square brackets
(`[...]') surrounding the elements, in sequence and with whitespace
separating them.  Vectors of length zero are not created; null pointers
are used instead.

   Expressions are classified by "expression codes" (also called RTX
codes).  The expression code is a name defined in `rtl.def', which is
also (in upper case) a C enumeration constant.  The possible expression
codes and their meanings are machine-independent.  The code of an RTX
can be extracted with the macro `GET_CODE (X)' and altered with
`PUT_CODE (X, NEWCODE)'.

   The expression code determines how many operands the expression
contains, and what kinds of objects they are.  In RTL, unlike Lisp, you
cannot tell by looking at an operand what kind of object it is.
Instead, you must know from its context--from the expression code of
the containing expression.  For example, in an expression of code
`subreg', the first operand is to be regarded as an expression and the
second operand as an integer.  In an expression of code `plus', there
are two operands, both of which are to be regarded as expressions.  In
a `symbol_ref' expression, there is one operand, which is to be
regarded as a string.

   Expressions are written as parentheses containing the name of the
expression type, its flags and machine mode if any, and then the
operands of the expression (separated by spaces).

   Expression code names in the `md' file are written in lower case,
but when they appear in C code they are written in upper case.  In this
manual, they are shown as follows: `const_int'.

   In a few contexts a null pointer is valid where an expression is
normally wanted.  The written form of this is `(nil)'.




Access to Operands
==================

   For each expression type `rtl.def' specifies the number of contained
objects and their kinds, with four possibilities: `e' for expression
(actually a pointer to an expression), `i' for integer, `w' for wide
integer, `s' for string, and `E' for vector of expressions.  The
sequence of letters for an expression code is called its "format".
Thus, the format of `subreg' is `ei'.

   A few other format characters are used occasionally:

`u'
     `u' is equivalent to `e' except that it is printed differently in
     debugging dumps.  It is used for pointers to insns.

`n'
     `n' is equivalent to `i' except that it is printed differently in
     debugging dumps.  It is used for the line number or code number of
     a `note' insn.

`S'
     `S' indicates a string which is optional.  In the RTL objects in
     core, `S' is equivalent to `s', but when the object is read, from
     an `md' file, the string value of this operand may be omitted.  An
     omitted string is taken to be the null string.

`V'
     `V' indicates a vector which is optional.  In the RTL objects in
     core, `V' is equivalent to `E', but when the object is read from
     an `md' file, the vector value of this operand may be omitted.  An
     omitted vector is effectively the same as a vector of no elements.

`0'
     `0' means a slot whose contents do not fit any normal category.
     `0' slots are not printed at all in dumps, and are often used in
     special ways by small parts of the compiler.

   There are macros to get the number of operands, the format, and the
class of an expression code:

`GET_RTX_LENGTH (CODE)'
     Number of operands of an RTX of code CODE.

`GET_RTX_FORMAT (CODE)'
     The format of an RTX of code CODE, as a C string.

`GET_RTX_CLASS (CODE)'
     A single character representing the type of RTX operation that code
     CODE performs.

     The following classes are defined:

    `o'
          An RTX code that represents an actual object, such as `reg' or
          `mem'.  `subreg' is not in this class.

    `<'
          An RTX code for a comparison.  The codes in this class are
          `NE', `EQ', `LE', `LT', `GE', `GT', `LEU', `LTU', `GEU',
          `GTU'.

    `1'
          An RTX code for a unary arithmetic operation, such as `neg'.

    `c'
          An RTX code for a commutative binary operation, other than
          `NE' and `EQ' (which have class `<').

    `2'
          An RTX code for a noncommutative binary operation, such as
          `MINUS'.

    `b'
          An RTX code for a bitfield operation, either `ZERO_EXTRACT' or
          `SIGN_EXTRACT'.

    `3'
          An RTX code for other three input operations, such as
          `IF_THEN_ELSE'.

    `i'
          An RTX code for a machine insn (`INSN', `JUMP_INSN', and
          `CALL_INSN').

    `m'
          An RTX code for something that matches in insns, such as
          `MATCH_DUP'.

    `x'
          All other RTX codes.

   Operands of expressions are accessed using the macros `XEXP',
`XINT', `XWINT' and `XSTR'.  Each of these macros takes two arguments:
an expression-pointer (RTX) and an operand number (counting from zero).
Thus,

     XEXP (X, 2)

accesses operand 2 of expression X, as an expression.

     XINT (X, 2)

accesses the same operand as an integer.  `XSTR', used in the same
fashion, would access it as a string.

   Any operand can be accessed as an integer, as an expression or as a
string.  You must choose the correct method of access for the kind of
value actually stored in the operand.  You would do this based on the
expression code of the containing expression.  That is also how you
would know how many operands there are.

   For example, if X is a `subreg' expression, you know that it has two
operands which can be correctly accessed as `XEXP (X, 0)' and `XINT (X,
1)'.  If you did `XINT (X, 0)', you would get the address of the
expression operand but cast as an integer; that might occasionally be
useful, but it would be cleaner to write `(int) XEXP (X, 0)'.  `XEXP
(X, 1)' would also compile without error, and would return the second,
integer operand cast as an expression pointer, which would probably
result in a crash when accessed.  Nothing stops you from writing `XEXP
(X, 28)' either, but this will access memory past the end of the
expression with unpredictable results.

   Access to operands which are vectors is more complicated.  You can
use the macro `XVEC' to get the vector-pointer itself, or the macros
`XVECEXP' and `XVECLEN' to access the elements and length of a vector.

`XVEC (EXP, IDX)'
     Access the vector-pointer which is operand number IDX in EXP.

`XVECLEN (EXP, IDX)'
     Access the length (number of elements) in the vector which is in
     operand number IDX in EXP.  This value is an `int'.

`XVECEXP (EXP, IDX, ELTNUM)'
     Access element number ELTNUM in the vector which is in operand
     number IDX in EXP.  This value is an RTX.

     It is up to you to make sure that ELTNUM is not negative and is
     less than `XVECLEN (EXP, IDX)'.

   All the macros defined in this section expand into lvalues and
therefore can be used to assign the operands, lengths and vector
elements as well as to access them.




Flags in an RTL Expression
==========================

   RTL expressions contain several flags (one-bit bitfields) that are
used in certain types of expression.  Most often they are accessed with
the following macros:

`MEM_VOLATILE_P (X)'
     In `mem' expressions, nonzero for volatile memory references.
     Stored in the `volatil' field and printed as `/v'.

`MEM_IN_STRUCT_P (X)'
     In `mem' expressions, nonzero for reference to an entire
     structure, union or array, or to a component of one.  Zero for
     references to a scalar variable or through a pointer to a scalar.
     Stored in the `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.

`REG_LOOP_TEST_P'
     In `reg' expressions, nonzero if this register's entire life is
     contained in the exit test code for some loop.  Stored in the
     `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.

`REG_USERVAR_P (X)'
     In a `reg', nonzero if it corresponds to a variable present in the
     user's source code.  Zero for temporaries generated internally by
     the compiler.  Stored in the `volatil' field and printed as `/v'.

`REG_FUNCTION_VALUE_P (X)'
     Nonzero in a `reg' if it is the place in which this function's
     value is going to be returned.  (This happens only in a hard
     register.)  Stored in the `integrated' field and printed as `/i'.

     The same hard register may be used also for collecting the values
     of functions called by this one, but `REG_FUNCTION_VALUE_P' is zero
     in this kind of use.

`SUBREG_PROMOTED_VAR_P'
     Nonzero in a `subreg' if it was made when accessing an object that
     was promoted to a wider mode in accord with the `PROMOTED_MODE'
     machine description macro (*note Storage Layout::.).  In this
     case, the mode of the `subreg' is the declared mode of the object
     and the mode of `SUBREG_REG' is the mode of the register that
     holds the object.  Promoted variables are always either sign- or
     zero-extended to the wider mode on every assignment.  Stored in
     the `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.

`SUBREG_PROMOTED_UNSIGNED_P'
     Nonzero in a `subreg' that has `SUBREG_PROMOTED_VAR_P' nonzero if
     the object being referenced is kept zero-extended and zero if it
     is kept sign-extended.  Stored in the `unchanging' field and
     printed as `/u'.

`RTX_UNCHANGING_P (X)'
     Nonzero in a `reg' or `mem' if the value is not changed.  (This
     flag is not set for memory references via pointers to constants.
     Such pointers only guarantee that the object will not be changed
     explicitly by the current function.  The object might be changed by
     other functions or by aliasing.)  Stored in the `unchanging' field
     and printed as `/u'.

`RTX_INTEGRATED_P (INSN)'
     Nonzero in an insn if it resulted from an in-line function call.
     Stored in the `integrated' field and printed as `/i'.  This may be
     deleted; nothing currently depends on it.

`SYMBOL_REF_USED (X)'
     In a `symbol_ref', indicates that X has been used.  This is
     normally only used to ensure that X is only declared external
     once.  Stored in the `used' field.

`SYMBOL_REF_FLAG (X)'
     In a `symbol_ref', this is used as a flag for machine-specific
     purposes.  Stored in the `volatil' field and printed as `/v'.

`LABEL_OUTSIDE_LOOP_P'
     In `label_ref' expressions, nonzero if this is a reference to a
     label that is outside the innermost loop containing the reference
     to the label.  Stored in the `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.

`INSN_DELETED_P (INSN)'
     In an insn, nonzero if the insn has been deleted.  Stored in the
     `volatil' field and printed as `/v'.

`INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P (INSN)'
     In an `insn' in the delay slot of a branch insn, indicates that an
     annulling branch should be used.  See the discussion under
     `sequence' below.  Stored in the `unchanging' field and printed as
     `/u'.

`INSN_FROM_TARGET_P (INSN)'
     In an `insn' in a delay slot of a branch, indicates that the insn
     is from the target of the branch.  If the branch insn has
     `INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P' set, this insn should only be executed if
     the branch is taken.  For annulled branches with this bit clear,
     the insn should be executed only if the branch is not taken.
     Stored in the `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.

`CONSTANT_POOL_ADDRESS_P (X)'
     Nonzero in a `symbol_ref' if it refers to part of the current
     function's "constants pool".  These are addresses close to the
     beginning of the function, and GNU CC assumes they can be addressed
     directly (perhaps with the help of base registers).  Stored in the
     `unchanging' field and printed as `/u'.

`CONST_CALL_P (X)'
     In a `call_insn', indicates that the insn represents a call to a
     const function.  Stored in the `unchanging' field and printed as
     `/u'.

`LABEL_PRESERVE_P (X)'
     In a `code_label', indicates that the label can never be deleted.
     Labels referenced by a non-local goto will have this bit set.
     Stored in the `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.

`SCHED_GROUP_P (INSN)'
     During instruction scheduling, in an insn, indicates that the
     previous insn must be scheduled together with this insn.  This is
     used to ensure that certain groups of instructions will not be
     split up by the instruction scheduling pass, for example, `use'
     insns before a `call_insn' may not be separated from the
     `call_insn'.  Stored in the `in_struct' field and printed as `/s'.

   These are the fields which the above macros refer to:

`used'
     Normally, this flag is used only momentarily, at the end of RTL
     generation for a function, to count the number of times an
     expression appears in insns.  Expressions that appear more than
     once are copied, according to the rules for shared structure
     (*note Sharing::.).

     In a `symbol_ref', it indicates that an external declaration for
     the symbol has already been written.

     In a `reg', it is used by the leaf register renumbering code to
     ensure that each register is only renumbered once.

`volatil'
     This flag is used in `mem', `symbol_ref' and `reg' expressions and
     in insns.  In RTL dump files, it is printed as `/v'.

     In a `mem' expression, it is 1 if the memory reference is volatile.
     Volatile memory references may not be deleted, reordered or
     combined.

     In a `symbol_ref' expression, it is used for machine-specific
     purposes.

     In a `reg' expression, it is 1 if the value is a user-level
     variable.  0 indicates an internal compiler temporary.

     In an insn, 1 means the insn has been deleted.

`in_struct'
     In `mem' expressions, it is 1 if the memory datum referred to is
     all or part of a structure or array; 0 if it is (or might be) a
     scalar variable.  A reference through a C pointer has 0 because
     the pointer might point to a scalar variable.  This information
     allows the compiler to determine something about possible cases of
     aliasing.

     In an insn in the delay slot of a branch, 1 means that this insn
     is from the target of the branch.

     During instruction scheduling, in an insn, 1 means that this insn
     must be scheduled as part of a group together with the previous
     insn.

     In `reg' expressions, it is 1 if the register has its entire life
     contained within the test expression of some loop.

     In `subreg' expressions, 1 means that the `subreg' is accessing an
     object that has had its mode promoted from a wider mode.

     In `label_ref' expressions, 1 means that the referenced label is
     outside the innermost loop containing the insn in which the
     `label_ref' was found.

     In `code_label' expressions, it is 1 if the label may never be
     deleted.  This is used for labels which are the target of
     non-local gotos.

     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as `/s'.

`unchanging'
     In `reg' and `mem' expressions, 1 means that the value of the
     expression never changes.

     In `subreg' expressions, it is 1 if the `subreg' references an
     unsigned object whose mode has been promoted to a wider mode.

     In an insn, 1 means that this is an annulling branch.

     In a `symbol_ref' expression, 1 means that this symbol addresses
     something in the per-function constants pool.

     In a `call_insn', 1 means that this instruction is a call to a
     const function.

     In an RTL dump, this flag is represented as `/u'.

`integrated'
     In some kinds of expressions, including insns, this flag means the
     rtl was produced by procedure integration.

     In a `reg' expression, this flag indicates the register containing
     the value to be returned by the current function.  On machines
     that pass parameters in registers, the same register number may be
     used for parameters as well, but this flag is not set on such uses.




Machine Modes
=============

   A machine mode describes a size of data object and the
representation used for it.  In the C code, machine modes are
represented by an enumeration type, `enum machine_mode', defined in
`machmode.def'.  Each RTL expression has room for a machine mode and so
do certain kinds of tree expressions (declarations and types, to be
precise).

   In debugging dumps and machine descriptions, the machine mode of an
RTL expression is written after the expression code with a colon to
separate them.  The letters `mode' which appear at the end of each
machine mode name are omitted.  For example, `(reg:SI 38)' is a `reg'
expression with machine mode `SImode'.  If the mode is `VOIDmode', it
is not written at all.

   Here is a table of machine modes.  The term "byte" below refers to an
object of `BITS_PER_UNIT' bits (*note Storage Layout::.).

`QImode'
     "Quarter-Integer" mode represents a single byte treated as an
     integer.

`HImode'
     "Half-Integer" mode represents a two-byte integer.

`PSImode'
     "Partial Single Integer" mode represents an integer which occupies
     four bytes but which doesn't really use all four.  On some
     machines, this is the right mode to use for pointers.

`SImode'
     "Single Integer" mode represents a four-byte integer.

`PDImode'
     "Partial Double Integer" mode represents an integer which occupies
     eight bytes but which doesn't really use all eight.  On some
     machines, this is the right mode to use for certain pointers.

`DImode'
     "Double Integer" mode represents an eight-byte integer.

`TImode'
     "Tetra Integer" (?) mode represents a sixteen-byte integer.

`SFmode'
     "Single Floating" mode represents a single-precision (four byte)
     floating point number.

`DFmode'
     "Double Floating" mode represents a double-precision (eight byte)
     floating point number.

`XFmode'
     "Extended Floating" mode represents a triple-precision (twelve
     byte) floating point number.  This mode is used for IEEE extended
     floating point.

`TFmode'
     "Tetra Floating" mode represents a quadruple-precision (sixteen
     byte) floating point number.

`CCmode'
     "Condition Code" mode represents the value of a condition code,
     which is a machine-specific set of bits used to represent the
     result of a comparison operation.  Other machine-specific modes
     may also be used for the condition code.  These modes are not used
     on machines that use `cc0' (see *note Condition Code::.).

`BLKmode'
     "Block" mode represents values that are aggregates to which none of
     the other modes apply.  In RTL, only memory references can have
     this mode, and only if they appear in string-move or vector
     instructions.  On machines which have no such instructions,
     `BLKmode' will not appear in RTL.

`VOIDmode'
     Void mode means the absence of a mode or an unspecified mode.  For
     example, RTL expressions of code `const_int' have mode `VOIDmode'
     because they can be taken to have whatever mode the context
     requires.  In debugging dumps of RTL, `VOIDmode' is expressed by
     the absence of any mode.

`SCmode, DCmode, XCmode, TCmode'
     These modes stand for a complex number represented as a pair of
     floating point values.  The floating point values are in `SFmode',
     `DFmode', `XFmode', and `TFmode', respectively.

`CQImode, CHImode, CSImode, CDImode, CTImode, COImode'
     These modes stand for a complex number represented as a pair of
     integer values.  The integer values are in `QImode', `HImode',
     `SImode', `DImode', `TImode', and `OImode', respectively.

   The machine description defines `Pmode' as a C macro which expands
into the machine mode used for addresses.  Normally this is the mode
whose size is `BITS_PER_WORD', `SImode' on 32-bit machines.

   The only modes which a machine description must support are
`QImode', and the modes corresponding to `BITS_PER_WORD',
`FLOAT_TYPE_SIZE' and `DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE'.  The compiler will attempt to
use `DImode' for 8-byte structures and unions, but this can be
prevented by overriding the definition of `MAX_FIXED_MODE_SIZE'.
Alternatively, you can have the compiler use `TImode' for 16-byte
structures and unions.  Likewise, you can arrange for the C type `short
int' to avoid using `HImode'.

   Very few explicit references to machine modes remain in the compiler
and these few references will soon be removed.  Instead, the machine
modes are divided into mode classes.  These are represented by the
enumeration type `enum mode_class' defined in `machmode.h'.  The
possible mode classes are:

`MODE_INT'
     Integer modes.  By default these are `QImode', `HImode', `SImode',
     `DImode', and `TImode'.

`MODE_PARTIAL_INT'
     The "partial integer" modes, `PSImode' and `PDImode'.

`MODE_FLOAT'
     floating point modes.  By default these are `SFmode', `DFmode',
     `XFmode' and `TFmode'.

`MODE_COMPLEX_INT'
     Complex integer modes.  (These are not currently implemented).

`MODE_COMPLEX_FLOAT'
     Complex floating point modes.  By default these are `SCmode',
     `DCmode', `XCmode', and `TCmode'.

`MODE_FUNCTION'
     Algol or Pascal function variables including a static chain.
     (These are not currently implemented).

`MODE_CC'
     Modes representing condition code values.  These are `CCmode' plus
     any modes listed in the `EXTRA_CC_MODES' macro.  *Note Jump
     Patterns::, also see *Note Condition Code::.

`MODE_RANDOM'
     This is a catchall mode class for modes which don't fit into the
     above classes.  Currently `VOIDmode' and `BLKmode' are in
     `MODE_RANDOM'.

   Here are some C macros that relate to machine modes:

`GET_MODE (X)'
     Returns the machine mode of the RTX X.

`PUT_MODE (X, NEWMODE)'
     Alters the machine mode of the RTX X to be NEWMODE.

`NUM_MACHINE_MODES'
     Stands for the number of machine modes available on the target
     machine.  This is one greater than the largest numeric value of any
     machine mode.

`GET_MODE_NAME (M)'
     Returns the name of mode M as a string.

`GET_MODE_CLASS (M)'
     Returns the mode class of mode M.

`GET_MODE_WIDER_MODE (M)'
     Returns the next wider natural mode.  For example, the expression
     `GET_MODE_WIDER_MODE (QImode)' returns `HImode'.

`GET_MODE_SIZE (M)'
     Returns the size in bytes of a datum of mode M.

`GET_MODE_BITSIZE (M)'
     Returns the size in bits of a datum of mode M.

`GET_MODE_MASK (M)'
     Returns a bitmask containing 1 for all bits in a word that fit
     within mode M.  This macro can only be used for modes whose
     bitsize is less than or equal to `HOST_BITS_PER_INT'.

`GET_MODE_ALIGNMENT (M))'
     Return the required alignment, in bits, for an object of mode M.

`GET_MODE_UNIT_SIZE (M)'
     Returns the size in bytes of the subunits of a datum of mode M.
     This is the same as `GET_MODE_SIZE' except in the case of complex
     modes.  For them, the unit size is the size of the real or
     imaginary part.

`GET_MODE_NUNITS (M)'
     Returns the number of units contained in a mode, i.e.,
     `GET_MODE_SIZE' divided by `GET_MODE_UNIT_SIZE'.

`GET_CLASS_NARROWEST_MODE (C)'
     Returns the narrowest mode in mode class C.

   The global variables `byte_mode' and `word_mode' contain modes whose
classes are `MODE_INT' and whose bitsizes are either `BITS_PER_UNIT' or
`BITS_PER_WORD', respectively.  On 32-bit machines, these are `QImode'
and `SImode', respectively.




Constant Expression Types
=========================

   The simplest RTL expressions are those that represent constant
values.

`(const_int I)'
     This type of expression represents the integer value I.  I is
     customarily accessed with the macro `INTVAL' as in `INTVAL (EXP)',
     which is equivalent to `XWINT (EXP, 0)'.

     There is only one expression object for the integer value zero; it
     is the value of the variable `const0_rtx'.  Likewise, the only
     expression for integer value one is found in `const1_rtx', the only
     expression for integer value two is found in `const2_rtx', and the
     only expression for integer value negative one is found in
     `constm1_rtx'.  Any attempt to create an expression of code
     `const_int' and value zero, one, two or negative one will return
     `const0_rtx', `const1_rtx', `const2_rtx' or `constm1_rtx' as
     appropriate.

     Similarly, there is only one object for the integer whose value is
     `STORE_FLAG_VALUE'.  It is found in `const_true_rtx'.  If
     `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is one, `const_true_rtx' and `const1_rtx' will
     point to the same object.  If `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is -1,
     `const_true_rtx' and `constm1_rtx' will point to the same object.

`(const_double:M ADDR I0 I1 ...)'
     Represents either a floating-point constant of mode M or an
     integer constant too large to fit into `HOST_BITS_PER_WIDE_INT'
     bits but small enough to fit within twice that number of bits (GNU
     CC does not provide a mechanism to represent even larger
     constants).  In the latter case, M will be `VOIDmode'.

     ADDR is used to contain the `mem' expression that corresponds to
     the location in memory that at which the constant can be found.  If
     it has not been allocated a memory location, but is on the chain
     of all `const_double' expressions in this compilation (maintained
     using an undisplayed field), ADDR contains `const0_rtx'.  If it is
     not on the chain, ADDR contains `cc0_rtx'.  ADDR is customarily
     accessed with the macro `CONST_DOUBLE_MEM' and the chain field via
     `CONST_DOUBLE_CHAIN'.

     If M is `VOIDmode', the bits of the value are stored in I0 and I1.
     I0 is customarily accessed with the macro `CONST_DOUBLE_LOW' and
     I1 with `CONST_DOUBLE_HIGH'.

     If the constant is floating point (regardless of its precision),
     then the number of integers used to store the value depends on the
     size of `REAL_VALUE_TYPE' (*note Cross-compilation::.).  The
     integers represent a floating point number, but not precisely in
     the target machine's or host machine's floating point format.  To
     convert them to the precise bit pattern used by the target
     machine, use the macro `REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE' and friends
     (*note Data Output::.).

     The macro `CONST0_RTX (MODE)' refers to an expression with value 0
     in mode MODE.  If mode MODE is of mode class `MODE_INT', it
     returns `const0_rtx'.  Otherwise, it returns a `CONST_DOUBLE'
     expression in mode MODE.  Similarly, the macro `CONST1_RTX (MODE)'
     refers to an expression with value 1 in mode MODE and similarly
     for `CONST2_RTX'.

`(const_string STR)'
     Represents a constant string with value STR.  Currently this is
     used only for insn attributes (*note Insn Attributes::.) since
     constant strings in C are placed in memory.

`(symbol_ref:MODE SYMBOL)'
     Represents the value of an assembler label for data.  SYMBOL is a
     string that describes the name of the assembler label.  If it
     starts with a `*', the label is the rest of SYMBOL not including
     the `*'.  Otherwise, the label is SYMBOL, usually prefixed with
     `_'.

     The `symbol_ref' contains a mode, which is usually `Pmode'.
     Usually that is the only mode for which a symbol is directly valid.

`(label_ref LABEL)'
     Represents the value of an assembler label for code.  It contains
     one operand, an expression, which must be a `code_label' that
     appears in the instruction sequence to identify the place where
     the label should go.

     The reason for using a distinct expression type for code label
     references is so that jump optimization can distinguish them.

`(const:M EXP)'
     Represents a constant that is the result of an assembly-time
     arithmetic computation.  The operand, EXP, is an expression that
     contains only constants (`const_int', `symbol_ref' and `label_ref'
     expressions) combined with `plus' and `minus'.  However, not all
     combinations are valid, since the assembler cannot do arbitrary
     arithmetic on relocatable symbols.

     M should be `Pmode'.

`(high:M EXP)'
     Represents the high-order bits of EXP, usually a `symbol_ref'.
     The number of bits is machine-dependent and is normally the number
     of bits specified in an instruction that initializes the high
     order bits of a register.  It is used with `lo_sum' to represent
     the typical two-instruction sequence used in RISC machines to
     reference a global memory location.

     M should be `Pmode'.

Registers and Memory
====================

   Here are the RTL expression types for describing access to machine
registers and to main memory.

`(reg:M N)'
     For small values of the integer N (those that are less than
     `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER'), this stands for a reference to machine
     register number N: a "hard register".  For larger values of N, it
     stands for a temporary value or "pseudo register".  The compiler's
     strategy is to generate code assuming an unlimited number of such
     pseudo registers, and later convert them into hard registers or
     into memory references.

     M is the machine mode of the reference.  It is necessary because
     machines can generally refer to each register in more than one
     mode.  For example, a register may contain a full word but there
     may be instructions to refer to it as a half word or as a single
     byte, as well as instructions to refer to it as a floating point
     number of various precisions.

     Even for a register that the machine can access in only one mode,
     the mode must always be specified.

     The symbol `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER' is defined by the machine
     description, since the number of hard registers on the machine is
     an invariant characteristic of the machine.  Note, however, that
     not all of the machine registers must be general registers.  All
     the machine registers that can be used for storage of data are
     given hard register numbers, even those that can be used only in
     certain instructions or can hold only certain types of data.

     A hard register may be accessed in various modes throughout one
     function, but each pseudo register is given a natural mode and is
     accessed only in that mode.  When it is necessary to describe an
     access to a pseudo register using a nonnatural mode, a `subreg'
     expression is used.

     A `reg' expression with a machine mode that specifies more than
     one word of data may actually stand for several consecutive
     registers.  If in addition the register number specifies a
     hardware register, then it actually represents several consecutive
     hardware registers starting with the specified one.

     Each pseudo register number used in a function's RTL code is
     represented by a unique `reg' expression.

     Some pseudo register numbers, those within the range of
     `FIRST_VIRTUAL_REGISTER' to `LAST_VIRTUAL_REGISTER' only appear
     during the RTL generation phase and are eliminated before the
     optimization phases.  These represent locations in the stack frame
     that cannot be determined until RTL generation for the function
     has been completed.  The following virtual register numbers are
     defined:

    `VIRTUAL_INCOMING_ARGS_REGNUM'
          This points to the first word of the incoming arguments
          passed on the stack.  Normally these arguments are placed
          there by the caller, but the callee may have pushed some
          arguments that were previously passed in registers.

          When RTL generation is complete, this virtual register is
          replaced by the sum of the register given by
          `ARG_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value of `FIRST_PARM_OFFSET'.

    `VIRTUAL_STACK_VARS_REGNUM'
          If `FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is defined, this points to
          immediately above the first variable on the stack.
          Otherwise, it points to the first variable on the stack.

          `VIRTUAL_STACK_VARS_REGNUM' is replaced with the sum of the
          register given by `FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value
          `STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET'.

    `VIRTUAL_STACK_DYNAMIC_REGNUM'
          This points to the location of dynamically allocated memory
          on the stack immediately after the stack pointer has been
          adjusted by the amount of memory desired.

          This virtual register is replaced by the sum of the register
          given by `STACK_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value
          `STACK_DYNAMIC_OFFSET'.

    `VIRTUAL_OUTGOING_ARGS_REGNUM'
          This points to the location in the stack at which outgoing
          arguments should be written when the stack is pre-pushed
          (arguments pushed using push insns should always use
          `STACK_POINTER_REGNUM').

          This virtual register is replaced by the sum of the register
          given by `STACK_POINTER_REGNUM' and the value
          `STACK_POINTER_OFFSET'.

`(subreg:M REG WORDNUM)'
     `subreg' expressions are used to refer to a register in a machine
     mode other than its natural one, or to refer to one register of a
     multi-word `reg' that actually refers to several registers.

     Each pseudo-register has a natural mode.  If it is necessary to
     operate on it in a different mode--for example, to perform a
     fullword move instruction on a pseudo-register that contains a
     single byte--the pseudo-register must be enclosed in a `subreg'.
     In such a case, WORDNUM is zero.

     Usually M is at least as narrow as the mode of REG, in which case
     it is restricting consideration to only the bits of REG that are
     in M.

     Sometimes M is wider than the mode of REG.  These `subreg'
     expressions are often called "paradoxical".  They are used in
     cases where we want to refer to an object in a wider mode but do
     not care what value the additional bits have.  The reload pass
     ensures that paradoxical references are only made to hard
     registers.

     The other use of `subreg' is to extract the individual registers of
     a multi-register value.  Machine modes such as `DImode' and
     `TImode' can indicate values longer than a word, values which
     usually require two or more consecutive registers.  To access one
     of the registers, use a `subreg' with mode `SImode' and a WORDNUM
     that says which register.

     Storing in a non-paradoxical `subreg' has undefined results for
     bits belonging to the same word as the `subreg'.  This laxity makes
     it easier to generate efficient code for such instructions.  To
     represent an instruction that preserves all the bits outside of
     those in the `subreg', use `strict_low_part' around the `subreg'.

     The compilation parameter `WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN', if set to 1, says
     that word number zero is the most significant part; otherwise, it
     is the least significant part.

     Between the combiner pass and the reload pass, it is possible to
     have a paradoxical `subreg' which contains a `mem' instead of a
     `reg' as its first operand.  After the reload pass, it is also
     possible to have a non-paradoxical `subreg' which contains a
     `mem'; this usually occurs when the `mem' is a stack slot which
     replaced a pseudo register.

     Note that it is not valid to access a `DFmode' value in `SFmode'
     using a `subreg'.  On some machines the most significant part of a
     `DFmode' value does not have the same format as a single-precision
     floating value.

     It is also not valid to access a single word of a multi-word value
     in a hard register when less registers can hold the value than
     would be expected from its size.  For example, some 32-bit
     machines have floating-point registers that can hold an entire
     `DFmode' value.  If register 10 were such a register `(subreg:SI
     (reg:DF 10) 1)' would be invalid because there is no way to
     convert that reference to a single machine register.  The reload
     pass prevents `subreg' expressions such as these from being formed.

     The first operand of a `subreg' expression is customarily accessed
     with the `SUBREG_REG' macro and the second operand is customarily
     accessed with the `SUBREG_WORD' macro.

`(scratch:M)'
     This represents a scratch register that will be required for the
     execution of a single instruction and not used subsequently.  It is
     converted into a `reg' by either the local register allocator or
     the reload pass.

     `scratch' is usually present inside a `clobber' operation (*note
     Side Effects::.).

`(cc0)'
     This refers to the machine's condition code register.  It has no
     operands and may not have a machine mode.  There are two ways to
     use it:

        * To stand for a complete set of condition code flags.  This is
          best on most machines, where each comparison sets the entire
          series of flags.

          With this technique, `(cc0)' may be validly used in only two
          contexts: as the destination of an assignment (in test and
          compare instructions) and in comparison operators comparing
          against zero (`const_int' with value zero; that is to say,
          `const0_rtx').

        * To stand for a single flag that is the result of a single
          condition.  This is useful on machines that have only a
          single flag bit, and in which comparison instructions must
          specify the condition to test.

          With this technique, `(cc0)' may be validly used in only two
          contexts: as the destination of an assignment (in test and
          compare instructions) where the source is a comparison
          operator, and as the first operand of `if_then_else' (in a
          conditional branch).

     There is only one expression object of code `cc0'; it is the value
     of the variable `cc0_rtx'.  Any attempt to create an expression of
     code `cc0' will return `cc0_rtx'.

     Instructions can set the condition code implicitly.  On many
     machines, nearly all instructions set the condition code based on
     the value that they compute or store.  It is not necessary to
     record these actions explicitly in the RTL because the machine
     description includes a prescription for recognizing the
     instructions that do so (by means of the macro
     `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC').  *Note Condition Code::.  Only instructions
     whose sole purpose is to set the condition code, and instructions
     that use the condition code, need mention `(cc0)'.

     On some machines, the condition code register is given a register
     number and a `reg' is used instead of `(cc0)'.  This is usually the
     preferable approach if only a small subset of instructions modify
     the condition code.  Other machines store condition codes in
     general registers; in such cases a pseudo register should be used.

     Some machines, such as the Sparc and RS/6000, have two sets of
     arithmetic instructions, one that sets and one that does not set
     the condition code.  This is best handled by normally generating
     the instruction that does not set the condition code, and making a
     pattern that both performs the arithmetic and sets the condition
     code register (which would not be `(cc0)' in this case).  For
     examples, search for `addcc' and `andcc' in `sparc.md'.

`(pc)'
     This represents the machine's program counter.  It has no operands
     and may not have a machine mode.  `(pc)' may be validly used only
     in certain specific contexts in jump instructions.

     There is only one expression object of code `pc'; it is the value
     of the variable `pc_rtx'.  Any attempt to create an expression of
     code `pc' will return `pc_rtx'.

     All instructions that do not jump alter the program counter
     implicitly by incrementing it, but there is no need to mention
     this in the RTL.

`(mem:M ADDR)'
     This RTX represents a reference to main memory at an address
     represented by the expression ADDR.  M specifies how large a unit
     of memory is accessed.




RTL Expressions for Arithmetic
==============================

   Unless otherwise specified, all the operands of arithmetic
expressions must be valid for mode M.  An operand is valid for mode M
if it has mode M, or if it is a `const_int' or `const_double' and M is
a mode of class `MODE_INT'.

   For commutative binary operations, constants should be placed in the
second operand.

`(plus:M X Y)'
     Represents the sum of the values represented by X and Y carried
     out in machine mode M.

`(lo_sum:M X Y)'
     Like `plus', except that it represents that sum of X and the
     low-order bits of Y.  The number of low order bits is
     machine-dependent but is normally the number of bits in a `Pmode'
     item minus the number of bits set by the `high' code (*note
     Constants::.).

     M should be `Pmode'.

`(minus:M X Y)'
     Like `plus' but represents subtraction.

`(compare:M X Y)'
     Represents the result of subtracting Y from X for purposes of
     comparison.  The result is computed without overflow, as if with
     infinite precision.

     Of course, machines can't really subtract with infinite precision.
     However, they can pretend to do so when only the sign of the
     result will be used, which is the case when the result is stored
     in the condition code.   And that is the only way this kind of
     expression may validly be used: as a value to be stored in the
     condition codes.

     The mode M is not related to the modes of X and Y, but instead is
     the mode of the condition code value.  If `(cc0)' is used, it is
     `VOIDmode'.  Otherwise it is some mode in class `MODE_CC', often
     `CCmode'.  *Note Condition Code::.

     Normally, X and Y must have the same mode.  Otherwise, `compare'
     is valid only if the mode of X is in class `MODE_INT' and Y is a
     `const_int' or `const_double' with mode `VOIDmode'.  The mode of X
     determines what mode the comparison is to be done in; thus it must
     not be `VOIDmode'.

     If one of the operands is a constant, it should be placed in the
     second operand and the comparison code adjusted as appropriate.

     A `compare' specifying two `VOIDmode' constants is not valid since
     there is no way to know in what mode the comparison is to be
     performed; the comparison must either be folded during the
     compilation or the first operand must be loaded into a register
     while its mode is still known.

`(neg:M X)'
     Represents the negation (subtraction from zero) of the value
     represented by X, carried out in mode M.

`(mult:M X Y)'
     Represents the signed product of the values represented by X and Y
     carried out in machine mode M.

     Some machines support a multiplication that generates a product
     wider than the operands.  Write the pattern for this as

          (mult:M (sign_extend:M X) (sign_extend:M Y))

     where M is wider than the modes of X and Y, which need not be the
     same.

     Write patterns for unsigned widening multiplication similarly using
     `zero_extend'.

`(div:M X Y)'
     Represents the quotient in signed division of X by Y, carried out
     in machine mode M.  If M is a floating point mode, it represents
     the exact quotient; otherwise, the integerized quotient.

     Some machines have division instructions in which the operands and
     quotient widths are not all the same; you should represent such
     instructions using `truncate' and `sign_extend' as in,

          (truncate:M1 (div:M2 X (sign_extend:M2 Y)))

`(udiv:M X Y)'
     Like `div' but represents unsigned division.

`(mod:M X Y)'
`(umod:M X Y)'
     Like `div' and `udiv' but represent the remainder instead of the
     quotient.

`(smin:M X Y)'
`(smax:M X Y)'
     Represents the smaller (for `smin') or larger (for `smax') of X
     and Y, interpreted as signed integers in mode M.

`(umin:M X Y)'
`(umax:M X Y)'
     Like `smin' and `smax', but the values are interpreted as unsigned
     integers.

`(not:M X)'
     Represents the bitwise complement of the value represented by X,
     carried out in mode M, which must be a fixed-point machine mode.

`(and:M X Y)'
     Represents the bitwise logical-and of the values represented by X
     and Y, carried out in machine mode M, which must be a fixed-point
     machine mode.

`(ior:M X Y)'
     Represents the bitwise inclusive-or of the values represented by X
     and Y, carried out in machine mode M, which must be a fixed-point
     mode.

`(xor:M X Y)'
     Represents the bitwise exclusive-or of the values represented by X
     and Y, carried out in machine mode M, which must be a fixed-point
     mode.

`(ashift:M X C)'
     Represents the result of arithmetically shifting X left by C
     places.  X have mode M, a fixed-point machine mode.  C be a
     fixed-point mode or be a constant with mode `VOIDmode'; which mode
     is determined by the mode called for in the machine description
     entry for the left-shift instruction.  For example, on the Vax,
     the mode of C is `QImode' regardless of M.

`(lshiftrt:M X C)'
`(ashiftrt:M X C)'
     Like `ashift' but for right shift.  Unlike the case for left shift,
     these two operations are distinct.

`(rotate:M X C)'
`(rotatert:M X C)'
     Similar but represent left and right rotate.  If C is a constant,
     use `rotate'.

`(abs:M X)'
     Represents the absolute value of X, computed in mode M.

`(sqrt:M X)'
     Represents the square root of X, computed in mode M.  Most often M
     will be a floating point mode.

`(ffs:M X)'
     Represents one plus the index of the least significant 1-bit in X,
     represented as an integer of mode M.  (The value is zero if X is
     zero.)  The mode of X need not be M; depending on the target
     machine, various mode combinations may be valid.




Comparison Operations
=====================

   Comparison operators test a relation on two operands and are
considered to represent a machine-dependent nonzero value described by,
but not necessarily equal to, `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' (*note Misc::.) if the
relation holds, or zero if it does not.  The mode of the comparison
operation is independent of the mode of the data being compared.  If
the comparison operation is being tested (e.g., the first operand of an
`if_then_else'), the mode must be `VOIDmode'.  If the comparison
operation is producing data to be stored in some variable, the mode
must be in class `MODE_INT'.  All comparison operations producing data
must use the same mode, which is machine-specific.

   There are two ways that comparison operations may be used.  The
comparison operators may be used to compare the condition codes `(cc0)'
against zero, as in `(eq (cc0) (const_int 0))'.  Such a construct
actually refers to the result of the preceding instruction in which the
condition codes were set.  The instructing setting the condition code
must be adjacent to the instruction using the condition code; only
`note' insns may separate them.

   Alternatively, a comparison operation may directly compare two data
objects.  The mode of the comparison is determined by the operands; they
must both be valid for a common machine mode.  A comparison with both
operands constant would be invalid as the machine mode could not be
deduced from it, but such a comparison should never exist in RTL due to
constant folding.

   In the example above, if `(cc0)' were last set to `(compare X Y)',
the comparison operation is identical to `(eq X Y)'.  Usually only one
style of comparisons is supported on a particular machine, but the
combine pass will try to merge the operations to produce the `eq' shown
in case it exists in the context of the particular insn involved.

   Inequality comparisons come in two flavors, signed and unsigned.
Thus, there are distinct expression codes `gt' and `gtu' for signed and
unsigned greater-than.  These can produce different results for the same
pair of integer values: for example, 1 is signed greater-than -1 but not
unsigned greater-than, because -1 when regarded as unsigned is actually
`0xffffffff' which is greater than 1.

   The signed comparisons are also used for floating point values.
Floating point comparisons are distinguished by the machine modes of
the operands.

`(eq:M X Y)'
     1 if the values represented by X and Y are equal, otherwise 0.

`(ne:M X Y)'
     1 if the values represented by X and Y are not equal, otherwise 0.

`(gt:M X Y)'
     1 if the X is greater than Y.  If they are fixed-point, the
     comparison is done in a signed sense.

`(gtu:M X Y)'
     Like `gt' but does unsigned comparison, on fixed-point numbers
     only.

`(lt:M X Y)'
`(ltu:M X Y)'
     Like `gt' and `gtu' but test for "less than".

`(ge:M X Y)'
`(geu:M X Y)'
     Like `gt' and `gtu' but test for "greater than or equal".

`(le:M X Y)'
`(leu:M X Y)'
     Like `gt' and `gtu' but test for "less than or equal".

`(if_then_else COND THEN ELSE)'
     This is not a comparison operation but is listed here because it is
     always used in conjunction with a comparison operation.  To be
     precise, COND is a comparison expression.  This expression
     represents a choice, according to COND, between the value
     represented by THEN and the one represented by ELSE.

     On most machines, `if_then_else' expressions are valid only to
     express conditional jumps.

`(cond [TEST1 VALUE1 TEST2 VALUE2 ...] DEFAULT)'
     Similar to `if_then_else', but more general.  Each of TEST1,
     TEST2, ... is performed in turn.  The result of this expression is
     the VALUE corresponding to the first non-zero test, or DEFAULT if
     none of the tests are non-zero expressions.

     This is currently not valid for instruction patterns and is
     supported only for insn attributes.  *Note Insn Attributes::.




Bit Fields
==========

   Special expression codes exist to represent bitfield instructions.
These types of expressions are lvalues in RTL; they may appear on the
left side of an assignment, indicating insertion of a value into the
specified bit field.

`(sign_extract:M LOC SIZE POS)'
     This represents a reference to a sign-extended bit field contained
     or starting in LOC (a memory or register reference).  The bit field
     is SIZE bits wide and starts at bit POS.  The compilation option
     `BITS_BIG_ENDIAN' says which end of the memory unit POS counts
     from.

     If LOC is in memory, its mode must be a single-byte integer mode.
     If LOC is in a register, the mode to use is specified by the
     operand of the `insv' or `extv' pattern (*note Standard Names::.)
     and is usually a full-word integer mode.

     The mode of POS is machine-specific and is also specified in the
     `insv' or `extv' pattern.

     The mode M is the same as the mode that would be used for LOC if
     it were a register.

`(zero_extract:M LOC SIZE POS)'
     Like `sign_extract' but refers to an unsigned or zero-extended bit
     field.  The same sequence of bits are extracted, but they are
     filled to an entire word with zeros instead of by sign-extension.




Conversions
===========

   All conversions between machine modes must be represented by
explicit conversion operations.  For example, an expression which is
the sum of a byte and a full word cannot be written as `(plus:SI
(reg:QI 34) (reg:SI 80))' because the `plus' operation requires two
operands of the same machine mode.  Therefore, the byte-sized operand
is enclosed in a conversion operation, as in

     (plus:SI (sign_extend:SI (reg:QI 34)) (reg:SI 80))

   The conversion operation is not a mere placeholder, because there
may be more than one way of converting from a given starting mode to
the desired final mode.  The conversion operation code says how to do
it.

   For all conversion operations, X must not be `VOIDmode' because the
mode in which to do the conversion would not be known.  The conversion
must either be done at compile-time or X must be placed into a register.

`(sign_extend:M X)'
     Represents the result of sign-extending the value X to machine
     mode M.  M must be a fixed-point mode and X a fixed-point value of
     a mode narrower than M.

`(zero_extend:M X)'
     Represents the result of zero-extending the value X to machine
     mode M.  M must be a fixed-point mode and X a fixed-point value of
     a mode narrower than M.

`(float_extend:M X)'
     Represents the result of extending the value X to machine mode M.
     m must be a floating point mode and X a floating point value of a
     mode narrower than M.

`(truncate:M X)'
     Represents the result of truncating the value X to machine mode M.
     M must be a fixed-point mode and X a fixed-point value of a mode
     wider than M.

`(float_truncate:M X)'
     Represents the result of truncating the value X to machine mode M.
     M must be a floating point mode and X a floating point value of a
     mode wider than M.

`(float:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting fixed point value X, regarded
     as signed, to floating point mode M.

`(unsigned_float:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting fixed point value X, regarded
     as unsigned, to floating point mode M.

`(fix:M X)'
     When M is a fixed point mode, represents the result of converting
     floating point value X to mode M, regarded as signed.  How
     rounding is done is not specified, so this operation may be used
     validly in compiling C code only for integer-valued operands.

`(unsigned_fix:M X)'
     Represents the result of converting floating point value X to
     fixed point mode M, regarded as unsigned.  How rounding is done is
     not specified.

`(fix:M X)'
     When M is a floating point mode, represents the result of
     converting floating point value X (valid for mode M) to an
     integer, still represented in floating point mode M, by rounding
     towards zero.




Declarations
============

   Declaration expression codes do not represent arithmetic operations
but rather state assertions about their operands.

`(strict_low_part (subreg:M (reg:N R) 0))'
     This expression code is used in only one context: as the
     destination operand of a `set' expression.  In addition, the
     operand of this expression must be a non-paradoxical `subreg'
     expression.

     The presence of `strict_low_part' says that the part of the
     register which is meaningful in mode N, but is not part of mode M,
     is not to be altered.  Normally, an assignment to such a subreg is
     allowed to have undefined effects on the rest of the register when
     M is less than a word.




Side Effect Expressions
=======================

   The expression codes described so far represent values, not actions.
But machine instructions never produce values; they are meaningful only
for their side effects on the state of the machine.  Special expression
codes are used to represent side effects.

   The body of an instruction is always one of these side effect codes;
the codes described above, which represent values, appear only as the
operands of these.

`(set LVAL X)'
     Represents the action of storing the value of X into the place
     represented by LVAL.  LVAL must be an expression representing a
     place that can be stored in: `reg' (or `subreg' or
     `strict_low_part'), `mem', `pc' or `cc0'.

     If LVAL is a `reg', `subreg' or `mem', it has a machine mode; then
     X must be valid for that mode.

     If LVAL is a `reg' whose machine mode is less than the full width
     of the register, then it means that the part of the register
     specified by the machine mode is given the specified value and the
     rest of the register receives an undefined value.  Likewise, if
     LVAL is a `subreg' whose machine mode is narrower than the mode of
     the register, the rest of the register can be changed in an
     undefined way.

     If LVAL is a `strict_low_part' of a `subreg', then the part of the
     register specified by the machine mode of the `subreg' is given
     the value X and the rest of the register is not changed.

     If LVAL is `(cc0)', it has no machine mode, and X may be either a
     `compare' expression or a value that may have any mode.  The
     latter case represents a "test" instruction.  The expression `(set
     (cc0) (reg:M N))' is equivalent to `(set (cc0) (compare (reg:M N)
     (const_int 0)))'.  Use the former expression to save space during
     the compilation.

     If LVAL is `(pc)', we have a jump instruction, and the
     possibilities for X are very limited.  It may be a `label_ref'
     expression (unconditional jump).  It may be an `if_then_else'
     (conditional jump), in which case either the second or the third
     operand must be `(pc)' (for the case which does not jump) and the
     other of the two must be a `label_ref' (for the case which does
     jump).  X may also be a `mem' or `(plus:SI (pc) Y)', where Y may
     be a `reg' or a `mem'; these unusual patterns are used to
     represent jumps through branch tables.

     If LVAL is neither `(cc0)' nor `(pc)', the mode of LVAL must not
     be `VOIDmode' and the mode of X must be valid for the mode of LVAL.

     LVAL is customarily accessed with the `SET_DEST' macro and X with
     the `SET_SRC' macro.

`(return)'
     As the sole expression in a pattern, represents a return from the
     current function, on machines where this can be done with one
     instruction, such as Vaxes.  On machines where a multi-instruction
     "epilogue" must be executed in order to return from the function,
     returning is done by jumping to a label which precedes the
     epilogue, and the `return' expression code is never used.

     Inside an `if_then_else' expression, represents the value to be
     placed in `pc' to return to the caller.

     Note that an insn pattern of `(return)' is logically equivalent to
     `(set (pc) (return))', but the latter form is never used.

`(call FUNCTION NARGS)'
     Represents a function call.  FUNCTION is a `mem' expression whose
     address is the address of the function to be called.  NARGS is an
     expression which can be used for two purposes: on some machines it
     represents the number of bytes of stack argument; on others, it
     represents the number of argument registers.

     Each machine has a standard machine mode which FUNCTION must have.
     The machine description defines macro `FUNCTION_MODE' to expand
     into the requisite mode name.  The purpose of this mode is to
     specify what kind of addressing is allowed, on machines where the
     allowed kinds of addressing depend on the machine mode being
     addressed.

`(clobber X)'
     Represents the storing or possible storing of an unpredictable,
     undescribed value into X, which must be a `reg', `scratch' or
     `mem' expression.

     One place this is used is in string instructions that store
     standard values into particular hard registers.  It may not be
     worth the trouble to describe the values that are stored, but it
     is essential to inform the compiler that the registers will be
     altered, lest it attempt to keep data in them across the string
     instruction.

     If X is `(mem:BLK (const_int 0))', it means that all memory
     locations must be presumed clobbered.

     Note that the machine description classifies certain hard
     registers as "call-clobbered".  All function call instructions are
     assumed by default to clobber these registers, so there is no need
     to use `clobber' expressions to indicate this fact.  Also, each
     function call is assumed to have the potential to alter any memory
     location, unless the function is declared `const'.

     If the last group of expressions in a `parallel' are each a
     `clobber' expression whose arguments are `reg' or `match_scratch'
     (*note RTL Template::.) expressions, the combiner phase can add
     the appropriate `clobber' expressions to an insn it has
     constructed when doing so will cause a pattern to be matched.

     This feature can be used, for example, on a machine that whose
     multiply and add instructions don't use an MQ register but which
     has an add-accumulate instruction that does clobber the MQ
     register.  Similarly, a combined instruction might require a
     temporary register while the constituent instructions might not.

     When a `clobber' expression for a register appears inside a
     `parallel' with other side effects, the register allocator
     guarantees that the register is unoccupied both before and after
     that insn.  However, the reload phase may allocate a register used
     for one of the inputs unless the `&' constraint is specified for
     the selected alternative (*note Modifiers::.).  You can clobber
     either a specific hard register, a pseudo register, or a `scratch'
     expression; in the latter two cases, GNU CC will allocate a hard
     register that is available there for use as a temporary.

     For instructions that require a temporary register, you should use
     `scratch' instead of a pseudo-register because this will allow the
     combiner phase to add the `clobber' when required.  You do this by
     coding (`clobber' (`match_scratch' ...)).  If you do clobber a
     pseudo register, use one which appears nowhere else--generate a
     new one each time.  Otherwise, you may confuse CSE.

     There is one other known use for clobbering a pseudo register in a
     `parallel': when one of the input operands of the insn is also
     clobbered by the insn.  In this case, using the same pseudo
     register in the clobber and elsewhere in the insn produces the
     expected results.

`(use X)'
     Represents the use of the value of X.  It indicates that the value
     in X at this point in the program is needed, even though it may
     not be apparent why this is so.  Therefore, the compiler will not
     attempt to delete previous instructions whose only effect is to
     store a value in X.  X must be a `reg' expression.

     During the delayed branch scheduling phase, X may be an insn.
     This indicates that X previously was located at this place in the
     code and its data dependencies need to be taken into account.
     These `use' insns will be deleted before the delayed branch
     scheduling phase exits.

`(parallel [X0 X1 ...])'
     Represents several side effects performed in parallel.  The square
     brackets stand for a vector; the operand of `parallel' is a vector
     of expressions.  X0, X1 and so on are individual side effect
     expressions--expressions of code `set', `call', `return',
     `clobber' or `use'.

     "In parallel" means that first all the values used in the
     individual side-effects are computed, and second all the actual
     side-effects are performed.  For example,

          (parallel [(set (reg:SI 1) (mem:SI (reg:SI 1)))
                     (set (mem:SI (reg:SI 1)) (reg:SI 1))])

     says unambiguously that the values of hard register 1 and the
     memory location addressed by it are interchanged.  In both places
     where `(reg:SI 1)' appears as a memory address it refers to the
     value in register 1 *before* the execution of the insn.

     It follows that it is *incorrect* to use `parallel' and expect the
     result of one `set' to be available for the next one.  For
     example, people sometimes attempt to represent a jump-if-zero
     instruction this way:

          (parallel [(set (cc0) (reg:SI 34))
                     (set (pc) (if_then_else
                                  (eq (cc0) (const_int 0))
                                  (label_ref ...)
                                  (pc)))])

     But this is incorrect, because it says that the jump condition
     depends on the condition code value *before* this instruction, not
     on the new value that is set by this instruction.

     Peephole optimization, which takes place together with final
     assembly code output, can produce insns whose patterns consist of
     a `parallel' whose elements are the operands needed to output the
     resulting assembler code--often `reg', `mem' or constant
     expressions.  This would not be well-formed RTL at any other stage
     in compilation, but it is ok then because no further optimization
     remains to be done.  However, the definition of the macro
     `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC', if any, must deal with such insns if you
     define any peephole optimizations.

`(sequence [INSNS ...])'
     Represents a sequence of insns.  Each of the INSNS that appears in
     the vector is suitable for appearing in the chain of insns, so it
     must be an `insn', `jump_insn', `call_insn', `code_label',
     `barrier' or `note'.

     A `sequence' RTX is never placed in an actual insn during RTL
     generation.  It represents the sequence of insns that result from a
     `define_expand' *before* those insns are passed to `emit_insn' to
     insert them in the chain of insns.  When actually inserted, the
     individual sub-insns are separated out and the `sequence' is
     forgotten.

     After delay-slot scheduling is completed, an insn and all the
     insns that reside in its delay slots are grouped together into a
     `sequence'.  The insn requiring the delay slot is the first insn
     in the vector; subsequent insns are to be placed in the delay slot.

     `INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P' is set on an insn in a delay slot to
     indicate that a branch insn should be used that will conditionally
     annul the effect of the insns in the delay slots.  In such a case,
     `INSN_FROM_TARGET_P' indicates that the insn is from the target of
     the branch and should be executed only if the branch is taken;
     otherwise the insn should be executed only if the branch is not
     taken.  *Note Delay Slots::.

   These expression codes appear in place of a side effect, as the body
of an insn, though strictly speaking they do not always describe side
effects as such:

`(asm_input S)'
     Represents literal assembler code as described by the string S.

`(unspec [OPERANDS ...] INDEX)'
`(unspec_volatile [OPERANDS ...] INDEX)'
     Represents a machine-specific operation on OPERANDS.  INDEX
     selects between multiple machine-specific operations.
     `unspec_volatile' is used for volatile operations and operations
     that may trap; `unspec' is used for other operations.

     These codes may appear inside a `pattern' of an insn, inside a
     `parallel', or inside an expression.

`(addr_vec:M [LR0 LR1 ...])'
     Represents a table of jump addresses.  The vector elements LR0,
     etc., are `label_ref' expressions.  The mode M specifies how much
     space is given to each address; normally M would be `Pmode'.

`(addr_diff_vec:M BASE [LR0 LR1 ...])'
     Represents a table of jump addresses expressed as offsets from
     BASE.  The vector elements LR0, etc., are `label_ref' expressions
     and so is BASE.  The mode M specifies how much space is given to
     each address-difference.




Embedded Side-Effects on Addresses
==================================

   Four special side-effect expression codes appear as memory addresses.

`(pre_dec:M X)'
     Represents the side effect of decrementing X by a standard amount
     and represents also the value that X has after being decremented.
     x must be a `reg' or `mem', but most machines allow only a `reg'.
     m must be the machine mode for pointers on the machine in use.
     The amount X is decremented by is the length in bytes of the
     machine mode of the containing memory reference of which this
     expression serves as the address.  Here is an example of its use:

          (mem:DF (pre_dec:SI (reg:SI 39)))

     This says to decrement pseudo register 39 by the length of a
     `DFmode' value and use the result to address a `DFmode' value.

`(pre_inc:M X)'
     Similar, but specifies incrementing X instead of decrementing it.

`(post_dec:M X)'
     Represents the same side effect as `pre_dec' but a different
     value.  The value represented here is the value X has before being
     decremented.

`(post_inc:M X)'
     Similar, but specifies incrementing X instead of decrementing it.

   These embedded side effect expressions must be used with care.
Instruction patterns may not use them.  Until the `flow' pass of the
compiler, they may occur only to represent pushes onto the stack.  The
`flow' pass finds cases where registers are incremented or decremented
in one instruction and used as an address shortly before or after;
these cases are then transformed to use pre- or post-increment or
-decrement.

   If a register used as the operand of these expressions is used in
another address in an insn, the original value of the register is used.
Uses of the register outside of an address are not permitted within the
same insn as a use in an embedded side effect expression because such
insns behave differently on different machines and hence must be treated
as ambiguous and disallowed.

   An instruction that can be represented with an embedded side effect
could also be represented using `parallel' containing an additional
`set' to describe how the address register is altered.  This is not
done because machines that allow these operations at all typically
allow them wherever a memory address is called for.  Describing them as
additional parallel stores would require doubling the number of entries
in the machine description.




Assembler Instructions as Expressions
=====================================

   The RTX code `asm_operands' represents a value produced by a
user-specified assembler instruction.  It is used to represent an `asm'
statement with arguments.  An `asm' statement with a single output
operand, like this:

     asm ("foo %1,%2,%0" : "=a" (outputvar) : "g" (x + y), "di" (*z));

is represented using a single `asm_operands' RTX which represents the
value that is stored in `outputvar':

     (set RTX-FOR-OUTPUTVAR
          (asm_operands "foo %1,%2,%0" "a" 0
                        [RTX-FOR-ADDITION-RESULT RTX-FOR-*Z]
                        [(asm_input:M1 "g")
                         (asm_input:M2 "di")]))

Here the operands of the `asm_operands' RTX are the assembler template
string, the output-operand's constraint, the index-number of the output
operand among the output operands specified, a vector of input operand
RTX's, and a vector of input-operand modes and constraints.  The mode
M1 is the mode of the sum `x+y'; M2 is that of `*z'.

   When an `asm' statement has multiple output values, its insn has
several such `set' RTX's inside of a `parallel'.  Each `set' contains a
`asm_operands'; all of these share the same assembler template and
vectors, but each contains the constraint for the respective output
operand.  They are also distinguished by the output-operand index
number, which is 0, 1, ... for successive output operands.


Insns
=====

   The RTL representation of the code for a function is a doubly-linked
chain of objects called "insns".  Insns are expressions with special
codes that are used for no other purpose.  Some insns are actual
instructions; others represent dispatch tables for `switch' statements;
others represent labels to jump to or various sorts of declarative
information.

   In addition to its own specific data, each insn must have a unique
id-number that distinguishes it from all other insns in the current
function (after delayed branch scheduling, copies of an insn with the
same id-number may be present in multiple places in a function, but
these copies will always be identical and will only appear inside a
`sequence'), and chain pointers to the preceding and following insns.
These three fields occupy the same position in every insn, independent
of the expression code of the insn.  They could be accessed with `XEXP'
and `XINT', but instead three special macros are always used:

`INSN_UID (I)'
     Accesses the unique id of insn I.

`PREV_INSN (I)'
     Accesses the chain pointer to the insn preceding I.  If I is the
     first insn, this is a null pointer.

`NEXT_INSN (I)'
     Accesses the chain pointer to the insn following I.  If I is the
     last insn, this is a null pointer.

   The first insn in the chain is obtained by calling `get_insns'; the
last insn is the result of calling `get_last_insn'.  Within the chain
delimited by these insns, the `NEXT_INSN' and `PREV_INSN' pointers must
always correspond: if INSN is not the first insn,

     NEXT_INSN (PREV_INSN (INSN)) == INSN

is always true and if INSN is not the last insn,

     PREV_INSN (NEXT_INSN (INSN)) == INSN

is always true.

   After delay slot scheduling, some of the insns in the chain might be
`sequence' expressions, which contain a vector of insns.  The value of
`NEXT_INSN' in all but the last of these insns is the next insn in the
vector; the value of `NEXT_INSN' of the last insn in the vector is the
same as the value of `NEXT_INSN' for the `sequence' in which it is
contained.  Similar rules apply for `PREV_INSN'.

   This means that the above invariants are not necessarily true for
insns inside `sequence' expressions.  Specifically, if INSN is the
first insn in a `sequence', `NEXT_INSN (PREV_INSN (INSN))' is the insn
containing the `sequence' expression, as is the value of `PREV_INSN
(NEXT_INSN (INSN))' is INSN is the last insn in the `sequence'
expression.  You can use these expressions to find the containing
`sequence' expression.

   Every insn has one of the following six expression codes:

`insn'
     The expression code `insn' is used for instructions that do not
     jump and do not do function calls.  `sequence' expressions are
     always contained in insns with code `insn' even if one of those
     insns should jump or do function calls.

     Insns with code `insn' have four additional fields beyond the three
     mandatory ones listed above.  These four are described in a table
     below.

`jump_insn'
     The expression code `jump_insn' is used for instructions that may
     jump (or, more generally, may contain `label_ref' expressions).  If
     there is an instruction to return from the current function, it is
     recorded as a `jump_insn'.

     `jump_insn' insns have the same extra fields as `insn' insns,
     accessed in the same way and in addition contain a field
     `JUMP_LABEL' which is defined once jump optimization has completed.

     For simple conditional and unconditional jumps, this field
     contains the `code_label' to which this insn will (possibly
     conditionally) branch.  In a more complex jump, `JUMP_LABEL'
     records one of the labels that the insn refers to; the only way to
     find the others is to scan the entire body of the insn.

     Return insns count as jumps, but since they do not refer to any
     labels, they have zero in the `JUMP_LABEL' field.

`call_insn'
     The expression code `call_insn' is used for instructions that may
     do function calls.  It is important to distinguish these
     instructions because they imply that certain registers and memory
     locations may be altered unpredictably.

     `call_insn' insns have the same extra fields as `insn' insns,
     accessed in the same way and in addition contain a field
     `CALL_INSN_FUNCTION_USAGE', which contains a list (chain of
     `expr_list' expressions) containing `use' and `clobber'
     expressions that denote hard registers used or clobbered by the
     called function.  A register specified in a `clobber' in this list
     is modified *after* the execution of the `call_insn', while a
     register in a `clobber' in the body of the `call_insn' is
     clobbered before the insn completes execution.  `clobber'
     expressions in this list augment registers specified in
     `CALL_USED_REGISTERS' (*note Register Basics::.).

`code_label'
     A `code_label' insn represents a label that a jump insn can jump
     to.  It contains two special fields of data in addition to the
     three standard ones.  `CODE_LABEL_NUMBER' is used to hold the
     "label number", a number that identifies this label uniquely among
     all the labels in the compilation (not just in the current
     function).  Ultimately, the label is represented in the assembler
     output as an assembler label, usually of the form `LN' where N is
     the label number.

     When a `code_label' appears in an RTL expression, it normally
     appears within a `label_ref' which represents the address of the
     label, as a number.

     The field `LABEL_NUSES' is only defined once the jump optimization
     phase is completed and contains the number of times this label is
     referenced in the current function.

`barrier'
     Barriers are placed in the instruction stream when control cannot
     flow past them.  They are placed after unconditional jump
     instructions to indicate that the jumps are unconditional and
     after calls to `volatile' functions, which do not return (e.g.,
     `exit').  They contain no information beyond the three standard
     fields.

`note'
     `note' insns are used to represent additional debugging and
     declarative information.  They contain two nonstandard fields, an
     integer which is accessed with the macro `NOTE_LINE_NUMBER' and a
     string accessed with `NOTE_SOURCE_FILE'.

     If `NOTE_LINE_NUMBER' is positive, the note represents the
     position of a source line and `NOTE_SOURCE_FILE' is the source
     file name that the line came from.  These notes control generation
     of line number data in the assembler output.

     Otherwise, `NOTE_LINE_NUMBER' is not really a line number but a
     code with one of the following values (and `NOTE_SOURCE_FILE' must
     contain a null pointer):

    `NOTE_INSN_DELETED'
          Such a note is completely ignorable.  Some passes of the
          compiler delete insns by altering them into notes of this
          kind.

    `NOTE_INSN_BLOCK_BEG'
    `NOTE_INSN_BLOCK_END'
          These types of notes indicate the position of the beginning
          and end of a level of scoping of variable names.  They
          control the output of debugging information.

    `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG'
    `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_END'
          These types of notes indicate the position of the beginning
          and end of a `while' or `for' loop.  They enable the loop
          optimizer to find loops quickly.

    `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_CONT'
          Appears at the place in a loop that `continue' statements
          jump to.

    `NOTE_INSN_LOOP_VTOP'
          This note indicates the place in a loop where the exit test
          begins for those loops in which the exit test has been
          duplicated.  This position becomes another virtual start of
          the loop when considering loop invariants.

    `NOTE_INSN_FUNCTION_END'
          Appears near the end of the function body, just before the
          label that `return' statements jump to (on machine where a
          single instruction does not suffice for returning).  This
          note may be deleted by jump optimization.

    `NOTE_INSN_SETJMP'
          Appears following each call to `setjmp' or a related function.

     These codes are printed symbolically when they appear in debugging
     dumps.

   The machine mode of an insn is normally `VOIDmode', but some phases
use the mode for various purposes; for example, the reload pass sets it
to `HImode' if the insn needs reloading but not register elimination
and `QImode' if both are required.  The common subexpression
elimination pass sets the mode of an insn to `QImode' when it is the
first insn in a block that has already been processed.

   Here is a table of the extra fields of `insn', `jump_insn' and
`call_insn' insns:

`PATTERN (I)'
     An expression for the side effect performed by this insn.  This
     must be one of the following codes: `set', `call', `use',
     `clobber', `return', `asm_input', `asm_output', `addr_vec',
     `addr_diff_vec', `trap_if', `unspec', `unspec_volatile',
     `parallel', or `sequence'.  If it is a `parallel', each element of
     the `parallel' must be one these codes, except that `parallel'
     expressions cannot be nested and `addr_vec' and `addr_diff_vec'
     are not permitted inside a `parallel' expression.

`INSN_CODE (I)'
     An integer that says which pattern in the machine description
     matches this insn, or -1 if the matching has not yet been
     attempted.

     Such matching is never attempted and this field remains -1 on an
     insn whose pattern consists of a single `use', `clobber',
     `asm_input', `addr_vec' or `addr_diff_vec' expression.

     Matching is also never attempted on insns that result from an `asm'
     statement.  These contain at least one `asm_operands' expression.
     The function `asm_noperands' returns a non-negative value for such
     insns.

     In the debugging output, this field is printed as a number
     followed by a symbolic representation that locates the pattern in
     the `md' file as some small positive or negative offset from a
     named pattern.

`LOG_LINKS (I)'
     A list (chain of `insn_list' expressions) giving information about
     dependencies between instructions within a basic block.  Neither a
     jump nor a label may come between the related insns.

`REG_NOTES (I)'
     A list (chain of `expr_list' and `insn_list' expressions) giving
     miscellaneous information about the insn.  It is often information
     pertaining to the registers used in this insn.

   The `LOG_LINKS' field of an insn is a chain of `insn_list'
expressions.  Each of these has two operands: the first is an insn, and
the second is another `insn_list' expression (the next one in the
chain).  The last `insn_list' in the chain has a null pointer as second
operand.  The significant thing about the chain is which insns appear
in it (as first operands of `insn_list' expressions).  Their order is
not significant.

   This list is originally set up by the flow analysis pass; it is a
null pointer until then.  Flow only adds links for those data
dependencies which can be used for instruction combination.  For each
insn, the flow analysis pass adds a link to insns which store into
registers values that are used for the first time in this insn.  The
instruction scheduling pass adds extra links so that every dependence
will be represented.  Links represent data dependencies,
antidependencies and output dependencies; the machine mode of the link
distinguishes these three types: antidependencies have mode
`REG_DEP_ANTI', output dependencies have mode `REG_DEP_OUTPUT', and
data dependencies have mode `VOIDmode'.

   The `REG_NOTES' field of an insn is a chain similar to the
`LOG_LINKS' field but it includes `expr_list' expressions in addition
to `insn_list' expressions.  There are several kinds of register notes,
which are distinguished by the machine mode, which in a register note
is really understood as being an `enum reg_note'.  The first operand OP
of the note is data whose meaning depends on the kind of note.

   The macro `REG_NOTE_KIND (X)' returns the kind of register note.
Its counterpart, the macro `PUT_REG_NOTE_KIND (X, NEWKIND)' sets the
register note type of X to be NEWKIND.

   Register notes are of three classes: They may say something about an
input to an insn, they may say something about an output of an insn, or
they may create a linkage between two insns.  There are also a set of
values that are only used in `LOG_LINKS'.

   These register notes annotate inputs to an insn:

`REG_DEAD'
     The value in OP dies in this insn; that is to say, altering the
     value immediately after this insn would not affect the future
     behavior of the program.

     This does not necessarily mean that the register OP has no useful
     value after this insn since it may also be an output of the insn.
     In such a case, however, a `REG_DEAD' note would be redundant and
     is usually not present until after the reload pass, but no code
     relies on this fact.

`REG_INC'
     The register OP is incremented (or decremented; at this level
     there is no distinction) by an embedded side effect inside this
     insn.  This means it appears in a `post_inc', `pre_inc',
     `post_dec' or `pre_dec' expression.

`REG_NONNEG'
     The register OP is known to have a nonnegative value when this
     insn is reached.  This is used so that decrement and branch until
     zero instructions, such as the m68k dbra, can be matched.

     The `REG_NONNEG' note is added to insns only if the machine
     description has a `decrement_and_branch_until_zero' pattern.

`REG_NO_CONFLICT'
     This insn does not cause a conflict between OP and the item being
     set by this insn even though it might appear that it does.  In
     other words, if the destination register and OP could otherwise be
     assigned the same register, this insn does not prevent that
     assignment.

     Insns with this note are usually part of a block that begins with a
     `clobber' insn specifying a multi-word pseudo register (which will
     be the output of the block), a group of insns that each set one
     word of the value and have the `REG_NO_CONFLICT' note attached,
     and a final insn that copies the output to itself with an attached
     `REG_EQUAL' note giving the expression being computed.  This block
     is encapsulated with `REG_LIBCALL' and `REG_RETVAL' notes on the
     first and last insns, respectively.

`REG_LABEL'
     This insn uses OP, a `code_label', but is not a `jump_insn'.  The
     presence of this note allows jump optimization to be aware that OP
     is, in fact, being used.

   The following notes describe attributes of outputs of an insn:

`REG_EQUIV'
`REG_EQUAL'
     This note is only valid on an insn that sets only one register and
     indicates that that register will be equal to OP at run time; the
     scope of this equivalence differs between the two types of notes.
     The value which the insn explicitly copies into the register may
     look different from OP, but they will be equal at run time.  If the
     output of the single `set' is a `strict_low_part' expression, the
     note refers to the register that is contained in `SUBREG_REG' of
     the `subreg' expression.

     For `REG_EQUIV', the register is equivalent to OP throughout the
     entire function, and could validly be replaced in all its
     occurrences by OP.  ("Validly" here refers to the data flow of the
     program; simple replacement may make some insns invalid.)  For
     example, when a constant is loaded into a register that is never
     assigned any other value, this kind of note is used.

     When a parameter is copied into a pseudo-register at entry to a
     function, a note of this kind records that the register is
     equivalent to the stack slot where the parameter was passed.
     Although in this case the register may be set by other insns, it
     is still valid to replace the register by the stack slot
     throughout the function.

     In the case of `REG_EQUAL', the register that is set by this insn
     will be equal to OP at run time at the end of this insn but not
     necessarily elsewhere in the function.  In this case, OP is
     typically an arithmetic expression.  For example, when a sequence
     of insns such as a library call is used to perform an arithmetic
     operation, this kind of note is attached to the insn that produces
     or copies the final value.

     These two notes are used in different ways by the compiler passes.
     `REG_EQUAL' is used by passes prior to register allocation (such as
     common subexpression elimination and loop optimization) to tell
     them how to think of that value.  `REG_EQUIV' notes are used by
     register allocation to indicate that there is an available
     substitute expression (either a constant or a `mem' expression for
     the location of a parameter on the stack) that may be used in
     place of a register if insufficient registers are available.

     Except for stack homes for parameters, which are indicated by a
     `REG_EQUIV' note and are not useful to the early optimization
     passes and pseudo registers that are equivalent to a memory
     location throughout there entire life, which is not detected until
     later in the compilation, all equivalences are initially indicated
     by an attached `REG_EQUAL' note.  In the early stages of register
     allocation, a `REG_EQUAL' note is changed into a `REG_EQUIV' note
     if OP is a constant and the insn represents the only set of its
     destination register.

     Thus, compiler passes prior to register allocation need only check
     for `REG_EQUAL' notes and passes subsequent to register allocation
     need only check for `REG_EQUIV' notes.

`REG_UNUSED'
     The register OP being set by this insn will not be used in a
     subsequent insn.  This differs from a `REG_DEAD' note, which
     indicates that the value in an input will not be used subsequently.
     These two notes are independent; both may be present for the same
     register.

`REG_WAS_0'
     The single output of this insn contained zero before this insn.
     OP is the insn that set it to zero.  You can rely on this note if
     it is present and OP has not been deleted or turned into a `note';
     its absence implies nothing.

   These notes describe linkages between insns.  They occur in pairs:
one insn has one of a pair of notes that points to a second insn, which
has the inverse note pointing back to the first insn.

`REG_RETVAL'
     This insn copies the value of a multi-insn sequence (for example, a
     library call), and OP is the first insn of the sequence (for a
     library call, the first insn that was generated to set up the
     arguments for the library call).

     Loop optimization uses this note to treat such a sequence as a
     single operation for code motion purposes and flow analysis uses
     this note to delete such sequences whose results are dead.

     A `REG_EQUAL' note will also usually be attached to this insn to
     provide the expression being computed by the sequence.

`REG_LIBCALL'
     This is the inverse of `REG_RETVAL': it is placed on the first
     insn of a multi-insn sequence, and it points to the last one.

`REG_CC_SETTER'
`REG_CC_USER'
     On machines that use `cc0', the insns which set and use `cc0' set
     and use `cc0' are adjacent.  However, when branch delay slot
     filling is done, this may no longer be true.  In this case a
     `REG_CC_USER' note will be placed on the insn setting `cc0' to
     point to the insn using `cc0' and a `REG_CC_SETTER' note will be
     placed on the insn using `cc0' to point to the insn setting `cc0'.

   These values are only used in the `LOG_LINKS' field, and indicate
the type of dependency that each link represents.  Links which indicate
a data dependence (a read after write dependence) do not use any code,
they simply have mode `VOIDmode', and are printed without any
descriptive text.

`REG_DEP_ANTI'
     This indicates an anti dependence (a write after read dependence).

`REG_DEP_OUTPUT'
     This indicates an output dependence (a write after write
     dependence).

   For convenience, the machine mode in an `insn_list' or `expr_list'
is printed using these symbolic codes in debugging dumps.

   The only difference between the expression codes `insn_list' and
`expr_list' is that the first operand of an `insn_list' is assumed to
be an insn and is printed in debugging dumps as the insn's unique id;
the first operand of an `expr_list' is printed in the ordinary way as
an expression.




RTL Representation of Function-Call Insns
=========================================

   Insns that call subroutines have the RTL expression code `call_insn'.
These insns must satisfy special rules, and their bodies must use a
special RTL expression code, `call'.

   A `call' expression has two operands, as follows:

     (call (mem:FM ADDR) NBYTES)

Here NBYTES is an operand that represents the number of bytes of
argument data being passed to the subroutine, FM is a machine mode
(which must equal as the definition of the `FUNCTION_MODE' macro in the
machine description) and ADDR represents the address of the subroutine.

   For a subroutine that returns no value, the `call' expression as
shown above is the entire body of the insn, except that the insn might
also contain `use' or `clobber' expressions.

   For a subroutine that returns a value whose mode is not `BLKmode',
the value is returned in a hard register.  If this register's number is
R, then the body of the call insn looks like this:

     (set (reg:M R)
          (call (mem:FM ADDR) NBYTES))

This RTL expression makes it clear (to the optimizer passes) that the
appropriate register receives a useful value in this insn.

   When a subroutine returns a `BLKmode' value, it is handled by
passing to the subroutine the address of a place to store the value.
So the call insn itself does not "return" any value, and it has the
same RTL form as a call that returns nothing.

   On some machines, the call instruction itself clobbers some register,
for example to contain the return address.  `call_insn' insns on these
machines should have a body which is a `parallel' that contains both
the `call' expression and `clobber' expressions that indicate which
registers are destroyed.  Similarly, if the call instruction requires
some register other than the stack pointer that is not explicitly
mentioned it its RTL, a `use' subexpression should mention that
register.

   Functions that are called are assumed to modify all registers listed
in the configuration macro `CALL_USED_REGISTERS' (*note Register
Basics::.) and, with the exception of `const' functions and library
calls, to modify all of memory.

   Insns containing just `use' expressions directly precede the
`call_insn' insn to indicate which registers contain inputs to the
function.  Similarly, if registers other than those in
`CALL_USED_REGISTERS' are clobbered by the called function, insns
containing a single `clobber' follow immediately after the call to
indicate which registers.




Structure Sharing Assumptions
=============================

   The compiler assumes that certain kinds of RTL expressions are
unique; there do not exist two distinct objects representing the same
value.  In other cases, it makes an opposite assumption: that no RTL
expression object of a certain kind appears in more than one place in
the containing structure.

   These assumptions refer to a single function; except for the RTL
objects that describe global variables and external functions, and a
few standard objects such as small integer constants, no RTL objects
are common to two functions.

   * Each pseudo-register has only a single `reg' object to represent
     it, and therefore only a single machine mode.

   * For any symbolic label, there is only one `symbol_ref' object
     referring to it.

   * There is only one `const_int' expression with value 0, only one
     with value 1, and only one with value -1.  Some other integer
     values are also stored uniquely.

   * There is only one `pc' expression.

   * There is only one `cc0' expression.

   * There is only one `const_double' expression with value 0 for each
     floating point mode.  Likewise for values 1 and 2.

   * No `label_ref' or `scratch' appears in more than one place in the
     RTL structure; in other words, it is safe to do a tree-walk of all
     the insns in the function and assume that each time a `label_ref'
     or `scratch' is seen it is distinct from all others that are seen.

   * Only one `mem' object is normally created for each static variable
     or stack slot, so these objects are frequently shared in all the
     places they appear.  However, separate but equal objects for these
     variables are occasionally made.

   * When a single `asm' statement has multiple output operands, a
     distinct `asm_operands' expression is made for each output operand.
     However, these all share the vector which contains the sequence of
     input operands.  This sharing is used later on to test whether two
     `asm_operands' expressions come from the same statement, so all
     optimizations must carefully preserve the sharing if they copy the
     vector at all.

   * No RTL object appears in more than one place in the RTL structure
     except as described above.  Many passes of the compiler rely on
     this by assuming that they can modify RTL objects in place without
     unwanted side-effects on other insns.

   * During initial RTL generation, shared structure is freely
     introduced.  After all the RTL for a function has been generated,
     all shared structure is copied by `unshare_all_rtl' in
     `emit-rtl.c', after which the above rules are guaranteed to be
     followed.

   * During the combiner pass, shared structure within an insn can exist
     temporarily.  However, the shared structure is copied before the
     combiner is finished with the insn.  This is done by calling
     `copy_rtx_if_shared', which is a subroutine of `unshare_all_rtl'.




Reading RTL
===========

   To read an RTL object from a file, call `read_rtx'.  It takes one
argument, a stdio stream, and returns a single RTL object.

   Reading RTL from a file is very slow.  This is no currently not a
problem because reading RTL occurs only as part of building the
compiler.

   People frequently have the idea of using RTL stored as text in a
file as an interface between a language front end and the bulk of GNU
CC.  This idea is not feasible.

   GNU CC was designed to use RTL internally only.  Correct RTL for a
given program is very dependent on the particular target machine.  And
the RTL does not contain all the information about the program.

   The proper way to interface GNU CC to a new language front end is
with the "tree" data structure.  There is no manual for this data
structure, but it is described in the files `tree.h' and `tree.def'.




Machine Descriptions
********************

   A machine description has two parts: a file of instruction patterns
(`.md' file) and a C header file of macro definitions.

   The `.md' file for a target machine contains a pattern for each
instruction that the target machine supports (or at least each
instruction that is worth telling the compiler about).  It may also
contain comments.  A semicolon causes the rest of the line to be a
comment, unless the semicolon is inside a quoted string.

   See the next chapter for information on the C header file.


Everything about Instruction Patterns
=====================================

   Each instruction pattern contains an incomplete RTL expression, with
pieces to be filled in later, operand constraints that restrict how the
pieces can be filled in, and an output pattern or C code to generate
the assembler output, all wrapped up in a `define_insn' expression.

   A `define_insn' is an RTL expression containing four or five
operands:

  1. An optional name.  The presence of a name indicate that this
     instruction pattern can perform a certain standard job for the
     RTL-generation pass of the compiler.  This pass knows certain
     names and will use the instruction patterns with those names, if
     the names are defined in the machine description.

     The absence of a name is indicated by writing an empty string
     where the name should go.  Nameless instruction patterns are never
     used for generating RTL code, but they may permit several simpler
     insns to be combined later on.

     Names that are not thus known and used in RTL-generation have no
     effect; they are equivalent to no name at all.

  2. The "RTL template" (*note RTL Template::.) is a vector of
     incomplete RTL expressions which show what the instruction should
     look like.  It is incomplete because it may contain
     `match_operand', `match_operator', and `match_dup' expressions
     that stand for operands of the instruction.

     If the vector has only one element, that element is the template
     for the instruction pattern.  If the vector has multiple elements,
     then the instruction pattern is a `parallel' expression containing
     the elements described.

  3. A condition.  This is a string which contains a C expression that
     is the final test to decide whether an insn body matches this
     pattern.

     For a named pattern, the condition (if present) may not depend on
     the data in the insn being matched, but only the
     target-machine-type flags.  The compiler needs to test these
     conditions during initialization in order to learn exactly which
     named instructions are available in a particular run.

     For nameless patterns, the condition is applied only when matching
     an individual insn, and only after the insn has matched the
     pattern's recognition template.  The insn's operands may be found
     in the vector `operands'.

  4. The "output template": a string that says how to output matching
     insns as assembler code.  `%' in this string specifies where to
     substitute the value of an operand.  *Note Output Template::.

     When simple substitution isn't general enough, you can specify a
     piece of C code to compute the output.  *Note Output Statement::.

  5. Optionally, a vector containing the values of attributes for insns
     matching this pattern.  *Note Insn Attributes::.




Example of `define_insn'
========================

   Here is an actual example of an instruction pattern, for the
68000/68020.

     (define_insn "tstsi"
       [(set (cc0)
             (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "rm"))]
       ""
       "*
     { if (TARGET_68020 || ! ADDRESS_REG_P (operands[0]))
         return \"tstl %0\";
       return \"cmpl #0,%0\"; }")

   This is an instruction that sets the condition codes based on the
value of a general operand.  It has no condition, so any insn whose RTL
description has the form shown may be handled according to this
pattern.  The name `tstsi' means "test a `SImode' value" and tells the
RTL generation pass that, when it is necessary to test such a value, an
insn to do so can be constructed using this pattern.

   The output control string is a piece of C code which chooses which
output template to return based on the kind of operand and the specific
type of CPU for which code is being generated.

   `"rm"' is an operand constraint.  Its meaning is explained below.




RTL Template
============

   The RTL template is used to define which insns match the particular
pattern and how to find their operands.  For named patterns, the RTL
template also says how to construct an insn from specified operands.

   Construction involves substituting specified operands into a copy of
the template.  Matching involves determining the values that serve as
the operands in the insn being matched.  Both of these activities are
controlled by special expression types that direct matching and
substitution of the operands.

`(match_operand:M N PREDICATE CONSTRAINT)'
     This expression is a placeholder for operand number N of the insn.
     When constructing an insn, operand number N will be substituted
     at this point.  When matching an insn, whatever appears at this
     position in the insn will be taken as operand number N; but it
     must satisfy PREDICATE or this instruction pattern will not match
     at all.

     Operand numbers must be chosen consecutively counting from zero in
     each instruction pattern.  There may be only one `match_operand'
     expression in the pattern for each operand number.  Usually
     operands are numbered in the order of appearance in `match_operand'
     expressions.

     PREDICATE is a string that is the name of a C function that
     accepts two arguments, an expression and a machine mode.  During
     matching, the function will be called with the putative operand as
     the expression and M as the mode argument (if M is not specified,
     `VOIDmode' will be used, which normally causes PREDICATE to accept
     any mode).  If it returns zero, this instruction pattern fails to
     match.  PREDICATE may be an empty string; then it means no test is
     to be done on the operand, so anything which occurs in this
     position is valid.

     Most of the time, PREDICATE will reject modes other than M--but
     not always.  For example, the predicate `address_operand' uses M
     as the mode of memory ref that the address should be valid for.
     Many predicates accept `const_int' nodes even though their mode is
     `VOIDmode'.

     CONSTRAINT controls reloading and the choice of the best register
     class to use for a value, as explained later (*note
     Constraints::.).

     People are often unclear on the difference between the constraint
     and the predicate.  The predicate helps decide whether a given
     insn matches the pattern.  The constraint plays no role in this
     decision; instead, it controls various decisions in the case of an
     insn which does match.

     On CISC machines, the most common PREDICATE is
     `"general_operand"'.  This function checks that the putative
     operand is either a constant, a register or a memory reference,
     and that it is valid for mode M.

     For an operand that must be a register, PREDICATE should be
     `"register_operand"'.  Using `"general_operand"' would be valid,
     since the reload pass would copy any non-register operands through
     registers, but this would make GNU CC do extra work, it would
     prevent invariant operands (such as constant) from being removed
     from loops, and it would prevent the register allocator from doing
     the best possible job.  On RISC machines, it is usually most
     efficient to allow PREDICATE to accept only objects that the
     constraints allow.

     For an operand that must be a constant, you must be sure to either
     use `"immediate_operand"' for PREDICATE, or make the instruction
     pattern's extra condition require a constant, or both.  You cannot
     expect the constraints to do this work!  If the constraints allow
     only constants, but the predicate allows something else, the
     compiler will crash when that case arises.

`(match_scratch:M N CONSTRAINT)'
     This expression is also a placeholder for operand number N and
     indicates that operand must be a `scratch' or `reg' expression.

     When matching patterns, this is equivalent to

          (match_operand:M N "scratch_operand" PRED)

     but, when generating RTL, it produces a (`scratch':M) expression.

     If the last few expressions in a `parallel' are `clobber'
     expressions whose operands are either a hard register or
     `match_scratch', the combiner can add or delete them when
     necessary.  *Note Side Effects::.

`(match_dup N)'
     This expression is also a placeholder for operand number N.  It is
     used when the operand needs to appear more than once in the insn.

     In construction, `match_dup' acts just like `match_operand': the
     operand is substituted into the insn being constructed.  But in
     matching, `match_dup' behaves differently.  It assumes that operand
     number N has already been determined by a `match_operand'
     appearing earlier in the recognition template, and it matches only
     an identical-looking expression.

`(match_operator:M N PREDICATE [OPERANDS...])'
     This pattern is a kind of placeholder for a variable RTL expression
     code.

     When constructing an insn, it stands for an RTL expression whose
     expression code is taken from that of operand N, and whose
     operands are constructed from the patterns OPERANDS.

     When matching an expression, it matches an expression if the
     function PREDICATE returns nonzero on that expression *and* the
     patterns OPERANDS match the operands of the expression.

     Suppose that the function `commutative_operator' is defined as
     follows, to match any expression whose operator is one of the
     commutative arithmetic operators of RTL and whose mode is MODE:

          int
          commutative_operator (x, mode)
               rtx x;
               enum machine_mode mode;
          {
            enum rtx_code code = GET_CODE (x);
            if (GET_MODE (x) != mode)
              return 0;
            return (GET_RTX_CLASS (code) == 'c'
                    || code == EQ || code == NE);
          }

     Then the following pattern will match any RTL expression consisting
     of a commutative operator applied to two general operands:

          (match_operator:SI 3 "commutative_operator"
            [(match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "g")
             (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "g")])

     Here the vector `[OPERANDS...]' contains two patterns because the
     expressions to be matched all contain two operands.

     When this pattern does match, the two operands of the commutative
     operator are recorded as operands 1 and 2 of the insn.  (This is
     done by the two instances of `match_operand'.)  Operand 3 of the
     insn will be the entire commutative expression: use `GET_CODE
     (operands[3])' to see which commutative operator was used.

     The machine mode M of `match_operator' works like that of
     `match_operand': it is passed as the second argument to the
     predicate function, and that function is solely responsible for
     deciding whether the expression to be matched "has" that mode.

     When constructing an insn, argument 3 of the gen-function will
     specify the operation (i.e. the expression code) for the
     expression to be made.  It should be an RTL expression, whose
     expression code is copied into a new expression whose operands are
     arguments 1 and 2 of the gen-function.  The subexpressions of
     argument 3 are not used; only its expression code matters.

     When `match_operator' is used in a pattern for matching an insn,
     it usually best if the operand number of the `match_operator' is
     higher than that of the actual operands of the insn.  This improves
     register allocation because the register allocator often looks at
     operands 1 and 2 of insns to see if it can do register tying.

     There is no way to specify constraints in `match_operator'.  The
     operand of the insn which corresponds to the `match_operator'
     never has any constraints because it is never reloaded as a whole.
     However, if parts of its OPERANDS are matched by `match_operand'
     patterns, those parts may have constraints of their own.

`(match_op_dup:M N[OPERANDS...])'
     Like `match_dup', except that it applies to operators instead of
     operands.  When constructing an insn, operand number N will be
     substituted at this point.  But in matching, `match_op_dup' behaves
     differently.  It assumes that operand number N has already been
     determined by a `match_operator' appearing earlier in the
     recognition template, and it matches only an identical-looking
     expression.

`(match_parallel N PREDICATE [SUBPAT...])'
     This pattern is a placeholder for an insn that consists of a
     `parallel' expression with a variable number of elements.  This
     expression should only appear at the top level of an insn pattern.

     When constructing an insn, operand number N will be substituted at
     this point.  When matching an insn, it matches if the body of the
     insn is a `parallel' expression with at least as many elements as
     the vector of SUBPAT expressions in the `match_parallel', if each
     SUBPAT matches the corresponding element of the `parallel', *and*
     the function PREDICATE returns nonzero on the `parallel' that is
     the body of the insn.  It is the responsibility of the predicate
     to validate elements of the `parallel' beyond those listed in the
     `match_parallel'.

     A typical use of `match_parallel' is to match load and store
     multiple expressions, which can contain a variable number of
     elements in a `parallel'.  For example,

          (define_insn ""
            [(match_parallel 0 "load_multiple_operation"
               [(set (match_operand:SI 1 "gpc_reg_operand" "=r")
                     (match_operand:SI 2 "memory_operand" "m"))
                (use (reg:SI 179))
                (clobber (reg:SI 179))])]
            ""
            "loadm 0,0,%1,%2")

     This example comes from `a29k.md'.  The function
     `load_multiple_operations' is defined in `a29k.c' and checks that
     subsequent elements in the `parallel' are the same as the `set' in
     the pattern, except that they are referencing subsequent registers
     and memory locations.

     An insn that matches this pattern might look like:

          (parallel
           [(set (reg:SI 20) (mem:SI (reg:SI 100)))
            (use (reg:SI 179))
            (clobber (reg:SI 179))
            (set (reg:SI 21)
                 (mem:SI (plus:SI (reg:SI 100)
                                  (const_int 4))))
            (set (reg:SI 22)
                 (mem:SI (plus:SI (reg:SI 100)
                                  (const_int 8))))])

`(match_par_dup N [SUBPAT...])'
     Like `match_op_dup', but for `match_parallel' instead of
     `match_operator'.

`(address (match_operand:M N "address_operand" ""))'
     This complex of expressions is a placeholder for an operand number
     N in a "load address" instruction: an operand which specifies a
     memory location in the usual way, but for which the actual operand
     value used is the address of the location, not the contents of the
     location.

     `address' expressions never appear in RTL code, only in machine
     descriptions.  And they are used only in machine descriptions that
     do not use the operand constraint feature.  When operand
     constraints are in use, the letter `p' in the constraint serves
     this purpose.

     M is the machine mode of the *memory location being addressed*,
     not the machine mode of the address itself.  That mode is always
     the same on a given target machine (it is `Pmode', which normally
     is `SImode'), so there is no point in mentioning it; thus, no
     machine mode is written in the `address' expression.  If some day
     support is added for machines in which addresses of different
     kinds of objects appear differently or are used differently (such
     as the PDP-10), different formats would perhaps need different
     machine modes and these modes might be written in the `address'
     expression.




Output Templates and Operand Substitution
=========================================

   The "output template" is a string which specifies how to output the
assembler code for an instruction pattern.  Most of the template is a
fixed string which is output literally.  The character `%' is used to
specify where to substitute an operand; it can also be used to identify
places where different variants of the assembler require different
syntax.

   In the simplest case, a `%' followed by a digit N says to output
operand N at that point in the string.

   `%' followed by a letter and a digit says to output an operand in an
alternate fashion.  Four letters have standard, built-in meanings
described below.  The machine description macro `PRINT_OPERAND' can
define additional letters with nonstandard meanings.

   `%cDIGIT' can be used to substitute an operand that is a constant
value without the syntax that normally indicates an immediate operand.

   `%nDIGIT' is like `%cDIGIT' except that the value of the constant is
negated before printing.

   `%aDIGIT' can be used to substitute an operand as if it were a
memory reference, with the actual operand treated as the address.  This
may be useful when outputting a "load address" instruction, because
often the assembler syntax for such an instruction requires you to
write the operand as if it were a memory reference.

   `%lDIGIT' is used to substitute a `label_ref' into a jump
instruction.

   `%=' outputs a number which is unique to each instruction in the
entire compilation.  This is useful for making local labels to be
referred to more than once in a single template that generates multiple
assembler instructions.

   `%' followed by a punctuation character specifies a substitution that
does not use an operand.  Only one case is standard: `%%' outputs a `%'
into the assembler code.  Other nonstandard cases can be defined in the
`PRINT_OPERAND' macro.  You must also define which punctuation
characters are valid with the `PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P' macro.

   The template may generate multiple assembler instructions.  Write
the text for the instructions, with `\;' between them.

   When the RTL contains two operands which are required by constraint
to match each other, the output template must refer only to the
lower-numbered operand.  Matching operands are not always identical,
and the rest of the compiler arranges to put the proper RTL expression
for printing into the lower-numbered operand.

   One use of nonstandard letters or punctuation following `%' is to
distinguish between different assembler languages for the same machine;
for example, Motorola syntax versus MIT syntax for the 68000.  Motorola
syntax requires periods in most opcode names, while MIT syntax does
not.  For example, the opcode `movel' in MIT syntax is `move.l' in
Motorola syntax.  The same file of patterns is used for both kinds of
output syntax, but the character sequence `%.' is used in each place
where Motorola syntax wants a period.  The `PRINT_OPERAND' macro for
Motorola syntax defines the sequence to output a period; the macro for
MIT syntax defines it to do nothing.

   As a special case, a template consisting of the single character `#'
instructs the compiler to first split the insn, and then output the
resulting instructions separately.  This helps eliminate redundancy in
the output templates.   If you have a `define_insn' that needs to emit
multiple assembler instructions, and there is an matching `define_split'
already defined, then you can simply use `#' as the output template
instead of writing an output template that emits the multiple assembler
instructions.

   If `ASSEMBLER_DIALECT' is defined, you can use
`{option0|option1|option2}' constructs in the templates.  These
describe multiple variants of assembler language syntax.  *Note
Instruction Output::.

C Statements for Assembler Output
=================================

   Often a single fixed template string cannot produce correct and
efficient assembler code for all the cases that are recognized by a
single instruction pattern.  For example, the opcodes may depend on the
kinds of operands; or some unfortunate combinations of operands may
require extra machine instructions.

   If the output control string starts with a `@', then it is actually
a series of templates, each on a separate line.  (Blank lines and
leading spaces and tabs are ignored.)  The templates correspond to the
pattern's constraint alternatives (*note Multi-Alternative::.).  For
example, if a target machine has a two-address add instruction `addr'
to add into a register and another `addm' to add a register to memory,
you might write this pattern:

     (define_insn "addsi3"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,m")
             (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0,0")
                      (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "g,r")))]
       ""
       "@
        addr %2,%0
        addm %2,%0")

   If the output control string starts with a `*', then it is not an
output template but rather a piece of C program that should compute a
template.  It should execute a `return' statement to return the
template-string you want.  Most such templates use C string literals,
which require doublequote characters to delimit them.  To include these
doublequote characters in the string, prefix each one with `\'.

   The operands may be found in the array `operands', whose C data type
is `rtx []'.

   It is very common to select different ways of generating assembler
code based on whether an immediate operand is within a certain range.
Be careful when doing this, because the result of `INTVAL' is an
integer on the host machine.  If the host machine has more bits in an
`int' than the target machine has in the mode in which the constant
will be used, then some of the bits you get from `INTVAL' will be
superfluous.  For proper results, you must carefully disregard the
values of those bits.

   It is possible to output an assembler instruction and then go on to
output or compute more of them, using the subroutine `output_asm_insn'.
This receives two arguments: a template-string and a vector of
operands.  The vector may be `operands', or it may be another array of
`rtx' that you declare locally and initialize yourself.

   When an insn pattern has multiple alternatives in its constraints,
often the appearance of the assembler code is determined mostly by
which alternative was matched.  When this is so, the C code can test
the variable `which_alternative', which is the ordinal number of the
alternative that was actually satisfied (0 for the first, 1 for the
second alternative, etc.).

   For example, suppose there are two opcodes for storing zero, `clrreg'
for registers and `clrmem' for memory locations.  Here is how a pattern
could use `which_alternative' to choose between them:

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,m")
             (const_int 0))]
       ""
       "*
       return (which_alternative == 0
               ? \"clrreg %0\" : \"clrmem %0\");
       ")

   The example above, where the assembler code to generate was *solely*
determined by the alternative, could also have been specified as
follows, having the output control string start with a `@':

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,m")

Operand Constraints
===================

   Each `match_operand' in an instruction pattern can specify a
constraint for the type of operands allowed.  Constraints can say
whether an operand may be in a register, and which kinds of register;
whether the operand can be a memory reference, and which kinds of
address; whether the operand may be an immediate constant, and which
possible values it may have.  Constraints can also require two operands
to match.


Simple Constraints
------------------

   The simplest kind of constraint is a string full of letters, each of
which describes one kind of operand that is permitted.  Here are the
letters that are allowed:

`m'
     A memory operand is allowed, with any kind of address that the
     machine supports in general.

`o'
     A memory operand is allowed, but only if the address is
     "offsettable".  This means that adding a small integer (actually,
     the width in bytes of the operand, as determined by its machine
     mode) may be added to the address and the result is also a valid
     memory address.

     For example, an address which is constant is offsettable; so is an
     address that is the sum of a register and a constant (as long as a
     slightly larger constant is also within the range of
     address-offsets supported by the machine); but an autoincrement or
     autodecrement address is not offsettable.  More complicated
     indirect/indexed addresses may or may not be offsettable depending
     on the other addressing modes that the machine supports.

     Note that in an output operand which can be matched by another
     operand, the constraint letter `o' is valid only when accompanied
     by both `<' (if the target machine has predecrement addressing)
     and `>' (if the target machine has preincrement addressing).

`V'
     A memory operand that is not offsettable.  In other words,
     anything that would fit the `m' constraint but not the `o'
     constraint.

`<'
     A memory operand with autodecrement addressing (either
     predecrement or postdecrement) is allowed.

`>'
     A memory operand with autoincrement addressing (either
     preincrement or postincrement) is allowed.

`r'
     A register operand is allowed provided that it is in a general
     register.

`d', `a', `f', ...
     Other letters can be defined in machine-dependent fashion to stand
     for particular classes of registers.  `d', `a' and `f' are defined
     on the 68000/68020 to stand for data, address and floating point
     registers.

`i'
     An immediate integer operand (one with constant value) is allowed.
     This includes symbolic constants whose values will be known only at
     assembly time.

`n'
     An immediate integer operand with a known numeric value is allowed.
     Many systems cannot support assembly-time constants for operands
     less than a word wide.  Constraints for these operands should use
     `n' rather than `i'.

`I', `J', `K', ... `P'
     Other letters in the range `I' through `P' may be defined in a
     machine-dependent fashion to permit immediate integer operands with
     explicit integer values in specified ranges.  For example, on the
     68000, `I' is defined to stand for the range of values 1 to 8.
     This is the range permitted as a shift count in the shift
     instructions.

`E'
     An immediate floating operand (expression code `const_double') is
     allowed, but only if the target floating point format is the same
     as that of the host machine (on which the compiler is running).

`F'
     An immediate floating operand (expression code `const_double') is
     allowed.

`G', `H'
     `G' and `H' may be defined in a machine-dependent fashion to
     permit immediate floating operands in particular ranges of values.

`s'
     An immediate integer operand whose value is not an explicit
     integer is allowed.

     This might appear strange; if an insn allows a constant operand
     with a value not known at compile time, it certainly must allow
     any known value.  So why use `s' instead of `i'?  Sometimes it
     allows better code to be generated.

     For example, on the 68000 in a fullword instruction it is possible
     to use an immediate operand; but if the immediate value is between
     -128 and 127, better code results from loading the value into a
     register and using the register.  This is because the load into
     the register can be done with a `moveq' instruction.  We arrange
     for this to happen by defining the letter `K' to mean "any integer
     outside the range -128 to 127", and then specifying `Ks' in the
     operand constraints.

`g'
     Any register, memory or immediate integer operand is allowed,
     except for registers that are not general registers.

`X'
     Any operand whatsoever is allowed, even if it does not satisfy
     `general_operand'.  This is normally used in the constraint of a
     `match_scratch' when certain alternatives will not actually
     require a scratch register.

`0', `1', `2', ... `9'
     An operand that matches the specified operand number is allowed.
     If a digit is used together with letters within the same
     alternative, the digit should come last.

     This is called a "matching constraint" and what it really means is
     that the assembler has only a single operand that fills two roles
     considered separate in the RTL insn.  For example, an add insn has
     two input operands and one output operand in the RTL, but on most
     CISC machines an add instruction really has only two operands, one
     of them an input-output operand:

          addl #35,r12

     Matching constraints are used in these circumstances.  More
     precisely, the two operands that match must include one input-only
     operand and one output-only operand.  Moreover, the digit must be a
     smaller number than the number of the operand that uses it in the
     constraint.

     For operands to match in a particular case usually means that they
     are identical-looking RTL expressions.  But in a few special cases
     specific kinds of dissimilarity are allowed.  For example, `*x' as
     an input operand will match `*x++' as an output operand.  For
     proper results in such cases, the output template should always
     use the output-operand's number when printing the operand.

`p'
     An operand that is a valid memory address is allowed.  This is for
     "load address" and "push address" instructions.

     `p' in the constraint must be accompanied by `address_operand' as
     the predicate in the `match_operand'.  This predicate interprets
     the mode specified in the `match_operand' as the mode of the memory
     reference for which the address would be valid.

`Q', `R', `S', ... `U'
     Letters in the range `Q' through `U' may be defined in a
     machine-dependent fashion to stand for arbitrary operand types.
     The machine description macro `EXTRA_CONSTRAINT' is passed the
     operand as its first argument and the constraint letter as its
     second operand.

     A typical use for this would be to distinguish certain types of
     memory references that affect other insn operands.

     Do not define these constraint letters to accept register
     references (`reg'); the reload pass does not expect this and would
     not handle it properly.

   In order to have valid assembler code, each operand must satisfy its
constraint.  But a failure to do so does not prevent the pattern from
applying to an insn.  Instead, it directs the compiler to modify the
code so that the constraint will be satisfied.  Usually this is done by
copying an operand into a register.

   Contrast, therefore, the two instruction patterns that follow:

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r")
             (plus:SI (match_dup 0)
                      (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "r")))]
       ""
       "...")

which has two operands, one of which must appear in two places, and

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r")
             (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
                      (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "r")))]
       ""
       "...")

which has three operands, two of which are required by a constraint to
be identical.  If we are considering an insn of the form

     (insn N PREV NEXT
       (set (reg:SI 3)
            (plus:SI (reg:SI 6) (reg:SI 109)))
       ...)

the first pattern would not apply at all, because this insn does not
contain two identical subexpressions in the right place.  The pattern
would say, "That does not look like an add instruction; try other
patterns." The second pattern would say, "Yes, that's an add
instruction, but there is something wrong with it."  It would direct
the reload pass of the compiler to generate additional insns to make
the constraint true.  The results might look like this:

     (insn N2 PREV N
       (set (reg:SI 3) (reg:SI 6))
       ...)

     (insn N N2 NEXT
       (set (reg:SI 3)
            (plus:SI (reg:SI 3) (reg:SI 109)))
       ...)

   It is up to you to make sure that each operand, in each pattern, has
constraints that can handle any RTL expression that could be present for
that operand.  (When multiple alternatives are in use, each pattern
must, for each possible combination of operand expressions, have at
least one alternative which can handle that combination of operands.)
The constraints don't need to *allow* any possible operand--when this is
the case, they do not constrain--but they must at least point the way to
reloading any possible operand so that it will fit.

   * If the constraint accepts whatever operands the predicate permits,
     there is no problem: reloading is never necessary for this operand.

     For example, an operand whose constraints permit everything except
     registers is safe provided its predicate rejects registers.

     An operand whose predicate accepts only constant values is safe
     provided its constraints include the letter `i'.  If any possible
     constant value is accepted, then nothing less than `i' will do; if
     the predicate is more selective, then the constraints may also be
     more selective.

   * Any operand expression can be reloaded by copying it into a
     register.  So if an operand's constraints allow some kind of
     register, it is certain to be safe.  It need not permit all
     classes of registers; the compiler knows how to copy a register
     into another register of the proper class in order to make an
     instruction valid.

   * A nonoffsettable memory reference can be reloaded by copying the
     address into a register.  So if the constraint uses the letter
     `o', all memory references are taken care of.

   * A constant operand can be reloaded by allocating space in memory to
     hold it as preinitialized data.  Then the memory reference can be
     used in place of the constant.  So if the constraint uses the
     letters `o' or `m', constant operands are not a problem.

   * If the constraint permits a constant and a pseudo register used in
     an insn was not allocated to a hard register and is equivalent to
     a constant, the register will be replaced with the constant.  If
     the predicate does not permit a constant and the insn is
     re-recognized for some reason, the compiler will crash.  Thus the
     predicate must always recognize any objects allowed by the
     constraint.

   If the operand's predicate can recognize registers, but the
constraint does not permit them, it can make the compiler crash.  When
this operand happens to be a register, the reload pass will be stymied,
because it does not know how to copy a register temporarily into memory.




Multiple Alternative Constraints
--------------------------------

   Sometimes a single instruction has multiple alternative sets of
possible operands.  For example, on the 68000, a logical-or instruction
can combine register or an immediate value into memory, or it can
combine any kind of operand into a register; but it cannot combine one
memory location into another.

   These constraints are represented as multiple alternatives.  An
alternative can be described by a series of letters for each operand.
The overall constraint for an operand is made from the letters for this
operand from the first alternative, a comma, the letters for this
operand from the second alternative, a comma, and so on until the last
alternative.  Here is how it is done for fullword logical-or on the
68000:

     (define_insn "iorsi3"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=m,d")
             (ior:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "%0,0")
                     (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand"
"dKs,dmKs")))]
       ...)

   The first alternative has `m' (memory) for operand 0, `0' for
operand 1 (meaning it must match operand 0), and `dKs' for operand 2.
The second alternative has `d' (data register) for operand 0, `0' for
operand 1, and `dmKs' for operand 2.  The `=' and `%' in the
constraints apply to all the alternatives; their meaning is explained
in the next section (*note Class Preferences::.).

   If all the operands fit any one alternative, the instruction is
valid.  Otherwise, for each alternative, the compiler counts how many
instructions must be added to copy the operands so that that
alternative applies.  The alternative requiring the least copying is
chosen.  If two alternatives need the same amount of copying, the one
that comes first is chosen.  These choices can be altered with the `?'
and `!' characters:

`?'
     Disparage slightly the alternative that the `?' appears in, as a
     choice when no alternative applies exactly.  The compiler regards
     this alternative as one unit more costly for each `?' that appears
     in it.

`!'
     Disparage severely the alternative that the `!' appears in.  This
     alternative can still be used if it fits without reloading, but if
     reloading is needed, some other alternative will be used.

   When an insn pattern has multiple alternatives in its constraints,
often the appearance of the assembler code is determined mostly by which
alternative was matched.  When this is so, the C code for writing the
assembler code can use the variable `which_alternative', which is the
ordinal number of the alternative that was actually satisfied (0 for
the first, 1 for the second alternative, etc.).  *Note Output
Statement::.




Register Class Preferences
--------------------------

   The operand constraints have another function: they enable the
compiler to decide which kind of hardware register a pseudo register is
best allocated to.  The compiler examines the constraints that apply to
the insns that use the pseudo register, looking for the
machine-dependent letters such as `d' and `a' that specify classes of
registers.  The pseudo register is put in whichever class gets the most
"votes".  The constraint letters `g' and `r' also vote: they vote in
favor of a general register.  The machine description says which
registers are considered general.

   Of course, on some machines all registers are equivalent, and no
register classes are defined.  Then none of this complexity is relevant.




Constraint Modifier Characters
------------------------------

   Here are constraint modifier characters.

`='
     Means that this operand is write-only for this instruction: the
     previous value is discarded and replaced by output data.

`+'
     Means that this operand is both read and written by the
     instruction.

     When the compiler fixes up the operands to satisfy the constraints,
     it needs to know which operands are inputs to the instruction and
     which are outputs from it.  `=' identifies an output; `+'
     identifies an operand that is both input and output; all other
     operands are assumed to be input only.

`&'
     Means (in a particular alternative) that this operand is written
     before the instruction is finished using the input operands.
     Therefore, this operand may not lie in a register that is used as
     an input operand or as part of any memory address.

     `&' applies only to the alternative in which it is written.  In
     constraints with multiple alternatives, sometimes one alternative
     requires `&' while others do not.  See, for example, the `movdf'
     insn of the 68000.

     `&' does not obviate the need to write `='.

`%'
     Declares the instruction to be commutative for this operand and the
     following operand.  This means that the compiler may interchange
     the two operands if that is the cheapest way to make all operands
     fit the constraints.  This is often used in patterns for addition
     instructions that really have only two operands: the result must
     go in one of the arguments.  Here for example, is how the 68000
     halfword-add instruction is defined:

          (define_insn "addhi3"
            [(set (match_operand:HI 0 "general_operand" "=m,r")
               (plus:HI (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" "%0,0")
                        (match_operand:HI 2 "general_operand" "di,g")))]
            ...)

`#'
     Says that all following characters, up to the next comma, are to be
     ignored as a constraint.  They are significant only for choosing
     register preferences.

`*'
     Says that the following character should be ignored when choosing
     register preferences.  `*' has no effect on the meaning of the
     constraint as a constraint, and no effect on reloading.

     Here is an example: the 68000 has an instruction to sign-extend a
     halfword in a data register, and can also sign-extend a value by
     copying it into an address register.  While either kind of
     register is acceptable, the constraints on an address-register
     destination are less strict, so it is best if register allocation
     makes an address register its goal.  Therefore, `*' is used so
     that the `d' constraint letter (for data register) is ignored when
     computing register preferences.

          (define_insn "extendhisi2"
            [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=*d,a")
                  (sign_extend:SI
                   (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" "0,g")))]
            ...)




Constraints for Particular Machines
-----------------------------------

   Whenever possible, you should use the general-purpose constraint
letters in `asm' arguments, since they will convey meaning more readily
to people reading your code.  Failing that, use the constraint letters
that usually have very similar meanings across architectures.  The most
commonly used constraints are `m' and `r' (for memory and
general-purpose registers respectively; *note Simple Constraints::.),
and `I', usually the letter indicating the most common
immediate-constant format.

   For each machine architecture, the `config/MACHINE.h' file defines
additional constraints.  These constraints are used by the compiler
itself for instruction generation, as well as for `asm' statements;
therefore, some of the constraints are not particularly interesting for
`asm'.  The constraints are defined through these macros:

`REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER'
     Register class constraints (usually lower case).

`CONST_OK_FOR_LETTER_P'
     Immediate constant constraints, for non-floating point constants of
     word size or smaller precision (usually upper case).

`CONST_DOUBLE_OK_FOR_LETTER_P'
     Immediate constant constraints, for all floating point constants
     and for constants of greater than word size precision (usually
     upper case).

`EXTRA_CONSTRAINT'
     Special cases of registers or memory.  This macro is not required,
     and is only defined for some machines.

   Inspecting these macro definitions in the compiler source for your
machine is the best way to be certain you have the right constraints.
However, here is a summary of the machine-dependent constraints
available on some particular machines.

Not Using Constraints
---------------------

   Some machines are so clean that operand constraints are not
required.  For example, on the Vax, an operand valid in one context is
valid in any other context.  On such a machine, every operand
constraint would be `g', excepting only operands of "load address"
instructions which are written as if they referred to a memory
location's contents but actual refer to its address.  They would have
constraint `p'.

   For such machines, instead of writing `g' and `p' for all the
constraints, you can choose to write a description with empty
constraints.  Then you write `""' for the constraint in every
`match_operand'.  Address operands are identified by writing an
`address' expression around the `match_operand', not by their
constraints.

   When the machine description has just empty constraints, certain
parts of compilation are skipped, making the compiler faster.  However,
few machines actually do not need constraints; all machine descriptions
now in existence use constraints.


Standard Pattern Names For Generation
=====================================

   Here is a table of the instruction names that are meaningful in the
RTL generation pass of the compiler.  Giving one of these names to an
instruction pattern tells the RTL generation pass that it can use the
pattern in to accomplish a certain task.

`movM'
     Here M stands for a two-letter machine mode name, in lower case.
     This instruction pattern moves data with that machine mode from
     operand 1 to operand 0.  For example, `movsi' moves full-word data.

     If operand 0 is a `subreg' with mode M of a register whose own
     mode is wider than M, the effect of this instruction is to store
     the specified value in the part of the register that corresponds
     to mode M.  The effect on the rest of the register is undefined.

     This class of patterns is special in several ways.  First of all,
     each of these names *must* be defined, because there is no other
     way to copy a datum from one place to another.

     Second, these patterns are not used solely in the RTL generation
     pass.  Even the reload pass can generate move insns to copy values
     from stack slots into temporary registers.  When it does so, one
     of the operands is a hard register and the other is an operand
     that can need to be reloaded into a register.

     Therefore, when given such a pair of operands, the pattern must
     generate RTL which needs no reloading and needs no temporary
     registers--no registers other than the operands.  For example, if
     you support the pattern with a `define_expand', then in such a
     case the `define_expand' mustn't call `force_reg' or any other such
     function which might generate new pseudo registers.

     This requirement exists even for subword modes on a RISC machine
     where fetching those modes from memory normally requires several
     insns and some temporary registers.  Look in `spur.md' to see how
     the requirement can be satisfied.

     During reload a memory reference with an invalid address may be
     passed as an operand.  Such an address will be replaced with a
     valid address later in the reload pass.  In this case, nothing may
     be done with the address except to use it as it stands.  If it is
     copied, it will not be replaced with a valid address.  No attempt
     should be made to make such an address into a valid address and no
     routine (such as `change_address') that will do so may be called.
     Note that `general_operand' will fail when applied to such an
     address.

     The global variable `reload_in_progress' (which must be explicitly
     declared if required) can be used to determine whether such special
     handling is required.

     The variety of operands that have reloads depends on the rest of
     the machine description, but typically on a RISC machine these can
     only be pseudo registers that did not get hard registers, while on
     other machines explicit memory references will get optional
     reloads.

     If a scratch register is required to move an object to or from
     memory, it can be allocated using `gen_reg_rtx' prior to reload.
     But this is impossible during and after reload.  If there are
     cases needing scratch registers after reload, you must define
     `SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' and perhaps also
     `SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' to detect them, and provide
     patterns `reload_inM' or `reload_outM' to handle them.  *Note
     Register Classes::.

     The constraints on a `moveM' must permit moving any hard register
     to any other hard register provided that `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'
     permits mode M in both registers and `REGISTER_MOVE_COST' applied
     to their classes returns a value of 2.

     It is obligatory to support floating point `moveM' instructions
     into and out of any registers that can hold fixed point values,
     because unions and structures (which have modes `SImode' or
     `DImode') can be in those registers and they may have floating
     point members.

     There may also be a need to support fixed point `moveM'
     instructions in and out of floating point registers.
     Unfortunately, I have forgotten why this was so, and I don't know
     whether it is still true.  If `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' rejects fixed
     point values in floating point registers, then the constraints of
     the fixed point `moveM' instructions must be designed to avoid
     ever trying to reload into a floating point register.

`reload_inM'
`reload_outM'
     Like `movM', but used when a scratch register is required to move
     between operand 0 and operand 1.  Operand 2 describes the scratch
     register.  See the discussion of the `SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS'
     macro in *note Register Classes::..

`movstrictM'
     Like `movM' except that if operand 0 is a `subreg' with mode M of
     a register whose natural mode is wider, the `movstrictM'
     instruction is guaranteed not to alter any of the register except
     the part which belongs to mode M.

`load_multiple'
     Load several consecutive memory locations into consecutive
     registers.  Operand 0 is the first of the consecutive registers,
     operand 1 is the first memory location, and operand 2 is a
     constant: the number of consecutive registers.

     Define this only if the target machine really has such an
     instruction; do not define this if the most efficient way of
     loading consecutive registers from memory is to do them one at a
     time.

     On some machines, there are restrictions as to which consecutive
     registers can be stored into memory, such as particular starting or
     ending register numbers or only a range of valid counts.  For those
     machines, use a `define_expand' (*note Expander Definitions::.)
     and make the pattern fail if the restrictions are not met.

     Write the generated insn as a `parallel' with elements being a
     `set' of one register from the appropriate memory location (you may
     also need `use' or `clobber' elements).  Use a `match_parallel'
     (*note RTL Template::.) to recognize the insn.  See `a29k.md' and
     `rs6000.md' for examples of the use of this insn pattern.

`store_multiple'
     Similar to `load_multiple', but store several consecutive registers
     into consecutive memory locations.  Operand 0 is the first of the
     consecutive memory locations, operand 1 is the first register, and
     operand 2 is a constant: the number of consecutive registers.

`addM3'
     Add operand 2 and operand 1, storing the result in operand 0.  All
     operands must have mode M.  This can be used even on two-address
     machines, by means of constraints requiring operands 1 and 0 to be
     the same location.

`subM3', `mulM3'
`divM3', `udivM3', `modM3', `umodM3'
`sminM3', `smaxM3', `uminM3', `umaxM3'
`andM3', `iorM3', `xorM3'
     Similar, for other arithmetic operations.

`mulhisi3'
     Multiply operands 1 and 2, which have mode `HImode', and store a
     `SImode' product in operand 0.

`mulqihi3', `mulsidi3'
     Similar widening-multiplication instructions of other widths.

`umulqihi3', `umulhisi3', `umulsidi3'
     Similar widening-multiplication instructions that do unsigned
     multiplication.

`divmodM4'
     Signed division that produces both a quotient and a remainder.
     Operand 1 is divided by operand 2 to produce a quotient stored in
     operand 0 and a remainder stored in operand 3.

     For machines with an instruction that produces both a quotient and
     a remainder, provide a pattern for `divmodM4' but do not provide
     patterns for `divM3' and `modM3'.  This allows optimization in the
     relatively common case when both the quotient and remainder are
     computed.

     If an instruction that just produces a quotient or just a remainder
     exists and is more efficient than the instruction that produces
     both, write the output routine of `divmodM4' to call
     `find_reg_note' and look for a `REG_UNUSED' note on the quotient
     or remainder and generate the appropriate instruction.

`udivmodM4'
     Similar, but does unsigned division.

`ashlM3'
     Arithmetic-shift operand 1 left by a number of bits specified by
     operand 2, and store the result in operand 0.  Here M is the mode
     of operand 0 and operand 1; operand 2's mode is specified by the
     instruction pattern, and the compiler will convert the operand to
     that mode before generating the instruction.

`ashrM3', `lshrM3', `rotlM3', `rotrM3'
     Other shift and rotate instructions, analogous to the `ashlM3'
     instructions.

`negM2'
     Negate operand 1 and store the result in operand 0.

`absM2'
     Store the absolute value of operand 1 into operand 0.

`sqrtM2'
     Store the square root of operand 1 into operand 0.

     The `sqrt' built-in function of C always uses the mode which
     corresponds to the C data type `double'.

`ffsM2'
     Store into operand 0 one plus the index of the least significant
     1-bit of operand 1.  If operand 1 is zero, store zero.  M is the
     mode of operand 0; operand 1's mode is specified by the instruction
     pattern, and the compiler will convert the operand to that mode
     before generating the instruction.

     The `ffs' built-in function of C always uses the mode which
     corresponds to the C data type `int'.

`one_cmplM2'
     Store the bitwise-complement of operand 1 into operand 0.

`cmpM'
     Compare operand 0 and operand 1, and set the condition codes.  The
     RTL pattern should look like this:

          (set (cc0) (compare (match_operand:M 0 ...)
                              (match_operand:M 1 ...)))

`tstM'
     Compare operand 0 against zero, and set the condition codes.  The
     RTL pattern should look like this:

          (set (cc0) (match_operand:M 0 ...))

     `tstM' patterns should not be defined for machines that do not use
     `(cc0)'.  Doing so would confuse the optimizer since it would no
     longer be clear which `set' operations were comparisons.  The
     `cmpM' patterns should be used instead.

`movstrM'
     Block move instruction.  The addresses of the destination and
     source strings are the first two operands, and both are in mode
     `Pmode'.  The number of bytes to move is the third operand, in
     mode M.

     The fourth operand is the known shared alignment of the source and
     destination, in the form of a `const_int' rtx.  Thus, if the
     compiler knows that both source and destination are word-aligned,
     it may provide the value 4 for this operand.

     These patterns need not give special consideration to the
     possibility that the source and destination strings might overlap.

`cmpstrM'
     Block compare instruction, with five operands.  Operand 0 is the
     output; it has mode M.  The remaining four operands are like the
     operands of `movstrM'.  The two memory blocks specified are
     compared byte by byte in lexicographic order.  The effect of the
     instruction is to store a value in operand 0 whose sign indicates
     the result of the comparison.

     Compute the length of a string, with three operands.  Operand 0 is
     the result (of mode M), operand 1 is a `mem' referring to the
     first character of the string, operand 2 is the character to
     search for (normally zero), and operand 3 is a constant describing
     the known alignment of the beginning of the string.

`floatMN2'
     Convert signed integer operand 1 (valid for fixed point mode M) to
     floating point mode N and store in operand 0 (which has mode N).

`floatunsMN2'
     Convert unsigned integer operand 1 (valid for fixed point mode M)
     to floating point mode N and store in operand 0 (which has mode N).

`fixMN2'
     Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode M) to fixed point
     mode N as a signed number and store in operand 0 (which has mode
     N).  This instruction's result is defined only when the value of
     operand 1 is an integer.

`fixunsMN2'
     Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode M) to fixed point
     mode N as an unsigned number and store in operand 0 (which has
     mode N).  This instruction's result is defined only when the value
     of operand 1 is an integer.

`ftruncM2'
     Convert operand 1 (valid for floating point mode M) to an integer
     value, still represented in floating point mode M, and store it in
     operand 0 (valid for floating point mode M).

`fix_truncMN2'
     Like `fixMN2' but works for any floating point value of mode M by
     converting the value to an integer.

`fixuns_truncMN2'
     Like `fixunsMN2' but works for any floating point value of mode M
     by converting the value to an integer.

`truncMN'
     Truncate operand 1 (valid for mode M) to mode N and store in
     operand 0 (which has mode N).  Both modes must be fixed point or
     both floating point.

`extendMN'
     Sign-extend operand 1 (valid for mode M) to mode N and store in
     operand 0 (which has mode N).  Both modes must be fixed point or
     both floating point.

`zero_extendMN'
     Zero-extend operand 1 (valid for mode M) to mode N and store in
     operand 0 (which has mode N).  Both modes must be fixed point.

`extv'
     Extract a bit field from operand 1 (a register or memory operand),
     where operand 2 specifies the width in bits and operand 3 the
     starting bit, and store it in operand 0.  Operand 0 must have mode
     `word_mode'.  Operand 1 may have mode `byte_mode' or `word_mode';
     often `word_mode' is allowed only for registers.  Operands 2 and 3
     must be valid for `word_mode'.

     The RTL generation pass generates this instruction only with
     constants for operands 2 and 3.

     The bit-field value is sign-extended to a full word integer before
     it is stored in operand 0.

`extzv'
     Like `extv' except that the bit-field value is zero-extended.

`insv'
     Store operand 3 (which must be valid for `word_mode') into a bit
     field in operand 0, where operand 1 specifies the width in bits and
     operand 2 the starting bit.  Operand 0 may have mode `byte_mode' or
     `word_mode'; often `word_mode' is allowed only for registers.
     Operands 1 and 2 must be valid for `word_mode'.

     The RTL generation pass generates this instruction only with
     constants for operands 1 and 2.

`sCOND'
     Store zero or nonzero in the operand according to the condition
     codes.  Value stored is nonzero iff the condition COND is true.
     cOND is the name of a comparison operation expression code, such
     as `eq', `lt' or `leu'.

     You specify the mode that the operand must have when you write the
     `match_operand' expression.  The compiler automatically sees which
     mode you have used and supplies an operand of that mode.

     The value stored for a true condition must have 1 as its low bit,
     or else must be negative.  Otherwise the instruction is not
     suitable and you should omit it from the machine description.  You
     describe to the compiler exactly which value is stored by defining
     the macro `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' (*note Misc::.).  If a description
     cannot be found that can be used for all the `sCOND' patterns, you
     should omit those operations from the machine description.

     These operations may fail, but should do so only in relatively
     uncommon cases; if they would fail for common cases involving
     integer comparisons, it is best to omit these patterns.

     If these operations are omitted, the compiler will usually
     generate code that copies the constant one to the target and
     branches around an assignment of zero to the target.  If this code
     is more efficient than the potential instructions used for the
     `sCOND' pattern followed by those required to convert the result
     into a 1 or a zero in `SImode', you should omit the `sCOND'
     operations from the machine description.

`bCOND'
     Conditional branch instruction.  Operand 0 is a `label_ref' that
     refers to the label to jump to.  Jump if the condition codes meet
     condition COND.

     Some machines do not follow the model assumed here where a
     comparison instruction is followed by a conditional branch
     instruction.  In that case, the `cmpM' (and `tstM') patterns should
     simply store the operands away and generate all the required insns
     in a `define_expand' (*note Expander Definitions::.) for the
     conditional branch operations.  All calls to expand `bCOND'
     patterns are immediately preceded by calls to expand either a
     `cmpM' pattern or a `tstM' pattern.

     Machines that use a pseudo register for the condition code value,
     or where the mode used for the comparison depends on the condition
     being tested, should also use the above mechanism.  *Note Jump
     Patterns::

     The above discussion also applies to `sCOND' patterns.

`call'
     Subroutine call instruction returning no value.  Operand 0 is the
     function to call; operand 1 is the number of bytes of arguments
     pushed (in mode `SImode', except it is normally a `const_int');
     operand 2 is the number of registers used as operands.

     On most machines, operand 2 is not actually stored into the RTL
     pattern.  It is supplied for the sake of some RISC machines which
     need to put this information into the assembler code; they can put
     it in the RTL instead of operand 1.

     Operand 0 should be a `mem' RTX whose address is the address of the
     function.  Note, however, that this address can be a `symbol_ref'
     expression even if it would not be a legitimate memory address on
     the target machine.  If it is also not a valid argument for a call
     instruction, the pattern for this operation should be a
     `define_expand' (*note Expander Definitions::.) that places the
     address into a register and uses that register in the call
     instruction.

`call_value'
     Subroutine call instruction returning a value.  Operand 0 is the
     hard register in which the value is returned.  There are three more
     operands, the same as the three operands of the `call' instruction
     (but with numbers increased by one).

     Subroutines that return `BLKmode' objects use the `call' insn.

`call_pop', `call_value_pop'
     Similar to `call' and `call_value', except used if defined and if
     `RETURN_POPS_ARGS' is non-zero.  They should emit a `parallel'
     that contains both the function call and a `set' to indicate the
     adjustment made to the frame pointer.

     For machines where `RETURN_POPS_ARGS' can be non-zero, the use of
     these patterns increases the number of functions for which the
     frame pointer can be eliminated, if desired.

`untyped_call'
     Subroutine call instruction returning a value of any type.
     Operand 0 is the function to call; operand 1 is a memory location
     where the result of calling the function is to be stored; operand
     2 is a `parallel' expression where each element is a `set'
     expression that indicates the saving of a function return value
     into the result block.

     This instruction pattern should be defined to support
     `__builtin_apply' on machines where special instructions are needed
     to call a subroutine with arbitrary arguments or to save the value
     returned.  This instruction pattern is required on machines that
     have multiple registers that can hold a return value (i.e.
     `FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P' is true for more than one register).

`return'
     Subroutine return instruction.  This instruction pattern name
     should be defined only if a single instruction can do all the work
     of returning from a function.

     Like the `movM' patterns, this pattern is also used after the RTL
     generation phase.  In this case it is to support machines where
     multiple instructions are usually needed to return from a
     function, but some class of functions only requires one
     instruction to implement a return.  Normally, the applicable
     functions are those which do not need to save any registers or
     allocate stack space.

     For such machines, the condition specified in this pattern should
     only be true when `reload_completed' is non-zero and the function's
     epilogue would only be a single instruction.  For machines with
     register windows, the routine `leaf_function_p' may be used to
     determine if a register window push is required.

     Machines that have conditional return instructions should define
     patterns such as

          (define_insn ""
            [(set (pc)
                  (if_then_else (match_operator
                                   0 "comparison_operator"
                                   [(cc0) (const_int 0)])
                                (return)
                                (pc)))]
            "CONDITION"
            "...")

     where CONDITION would normally be the same condition specified on
     the named `return' pattern.

`untyped_return'
     Untyped subroutine return instruction.  This instruction pattern
     should be defined to support `__builtin_return' on machines where
     special instructions are needed to return a value of any type.

     Operand 0 is a memory location where the result of calling a
     function with `__builtin_apply' is stored; operand 1 is a
     `parallel' expression where each element is a `set' expression
     that indicates the restoring of a function return value from the
     result block.

`nop'
     No-op instruction.  This instruction pattern name should always be
     defined to output a no-op in assembler code.  `(const_int 0)' will
     do as an RTL pattern.

`indirect_jump'
     An instruction to jump to an address which is operand zero.  This
     pattern name is mandatory on all machines.

`casesi'
     Instruction to jump through a dispatch table, including bounds
     checking.  This instruction takes five operands:

       1. The index to dispatch on, which has mode `SImode'.

       2. The lower bound for indices in the table, an integer constant.

       3. The total range of indices in the table--the largest index
          minus the smallest one (both inclusive).

       4. A label that precedes the table itself.

       5. A label to jump to if the index has a value outside the
          bounds.  (If the machine-description macro
          `CASE_DROPS_THROUGH' is defined, then an out-of-bounds index
          drops through to the code following the jump table instead of
          jumping to this label.  In that case, this label is not
          actually used by the `casesi' instruction, but it is always
          provided as an operand.)

     The table is a `addr_vec' or `addr_diff_vec' inside of a
     `jump_insn'.  The number of elements in the table is one plus the
     difference between the upper bound and the lower bound.

`tablejump'
     Instruction to jump to a variable address.  This is a low-level
     capability which can be used to implement a dispatch table when
     there is no `casesi' pattern.

     This pattern requires two operands: the address or offset, and a
     label which should immediately precede the jump table.  If the
     macro `CASE_VECTOR_PC_RELATIVE' is defined then the first operand
     is an offset which counts from the address of the table;
     otherwise, it is an absolute address to jump to.  In either case,
     the first operand has mode `Pmode'.

     The `tablejump' insn is always the last insn before the jump table
     it uses.  Its assembler code normally has no need to use the
     second operand, but you should incorporate it in the RTL pattern so
     that the jump optimizer will not delete the table as unreachable
     code.

`save_stack_block'
`save_stack_function'
`save_stack_nonlocal'
`restore_stack_block'
`restore_stack_function'
`restore_stack_nonlocal'
     Most machines save and restore the stack pointer by copying it to
     or from an object of mode `Pmode'.  Do not define these patterns on
     such machines.

     Some machines require special handling for stack pointer saves and
     restores.  On those machines, define the patterns corresponding to
     the non-standard cases by using a `define_expand' (*note Expander
     Definitions::.) that produces the required insns.  The three types
     of saves and restores are:

       1. `save_stack_block' saves the stack pointer at the start of a
          block that allocates a variable-sized object, and
          `restore_stack_block' restores the stack pointer when the
          block is exited.

       2. `save_stack_function' and `restore_stack_function' do a
          similar job for the outermost block of a function and are
          used when the function allocates variable-sized objects or
          calls `alloca'.  Only the epilogue uses the restored stack
          pointer, allowing a simpler save or restore sequence on some
          machines.

       3. `save_stack_nonlocal' is used in functions that contain labels
          branched to by nested functions.  It saves the stack pointer
          in such a way that the inner function can use
          `restore_stack_nonlocal' to restore the stack pointer.  The
          compiler generates code to restore the frame and argument
          pointer registers, but some machines require saving and
          restoring additional data such as register window information
          or stack backchains.  Place insns in these patterns to save
          and restore any such required data.

     When saving the stack pointer, operand 0 is the save area and
     operand 1 is the stack pointer.  The mode used to allocate the
     save area is the mode of operand 0.  You must specify an integral
     mode, or `VOIDmode' if no save area is needed for a particular
     type of save (either because no save is needed or because a
     machine-specific save area can be used).  Operand 0 is the stack
     pointer and operand 1 is the save area for restore operations.  If
     `save_stack_block' is defined, operand 0 must not be `VOIDmode'
     since these saves can be arbitrarily nested.

     A save area is a `mem' that is at a constant offset from
     `virtual_stack_vars_rtx' when the stack pointer is saved for use by
     nonlocal gotos and a `reg' in the other two cases.

`allocate_stack'
     Subtract (or add if `STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is undefined) operand 0
     from the stack pointer to create space for dynamically allocated
     data.

     Do not define this pattern if all that must be done is the
     subtraction.  Some machines require other operations such as stack
     probes or maintaining the back chain.  Define this pattern to emit
     those operations in addition to updating the stack pointer.




When the Order of Patterns Matters
==================================

   Sometimes an insn can match more than one instruction pattern.  Then
the pattern that appears first in the machine description is the one
used.  Therefore, more specific patterns (patterns that will match
fewer things) and faster instructions (those that will produce better
code when they do match) should usually go first in the description.

   In some cases the effect of ordering the patterns can be used to hide
a pattern when it is not valid.  For example, the 68000 has an
instruction for converting a fullword to floating point and another for
converting a byte to floating point.  An instruction converting an
integer to floating point could match either one.  We put the pattern
to convert the fullword first to make sure that one will be used rather
than the other.  (Otherwise a large integer might be generated as a
single-byte immediate quantity, which would not work.) Instead of using
this pattern ordering it would be possible to make the pattern for
convert-a-byte smart enough to deal properly with any constant value.




Interdependence of Patterns
===========================

   Every machine description must have a named pattern for each of the
conditional branch names `bCOND'.  The recognition template must always
have the form

     (set (pc)
          (if_then_else (COND (cc0) (const_int 0))
                        (label_ref (match_operand 0 "" ""))
                        (pc)))

In addition, every machine description must have an anonymous pattern
for each of the possible reverse-conditional branches.  Their templates
look like

     (set (pc)
          (if_then_else (COND (cc0) (const_int 0))
                        (pc)
                        (label_ref (match_operand 0 "" ""))))

They are necessary because jump optimization can turn direct-conditional
branches into reverse-conditional branches.

   It is often convenient to use the `match_operator' construct to
reduce the number of patterns that must be specified for branches.  For
example,

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (pc)
             (if_then_else (match_operator 0 "comparison_operator"
                                           [(cc0) (const_int 0)])
                           (pc)
                           (label_ref (match_operand 1 "" ""))))]
       "CONDITION"
       "...")

   In some cases machines support instructions identical except for the
machine mode of one or more operands.  For example, there may be
"sign-extend halfword" and "sign-extend byte" instructions whose
patterns are

     (set (match_operand:SI 0 ...)
          (extend:SI (match_operand:HI 1 ...)))

     (set (match_operand:SI 0 ...)
          (extend:SI (match_operand:QI 1 ...)))

Constant integers do not specify a machine mode, so an instruction to
extend a constant value could match either pattern.  The pattern it
actually will match is the one that appears first in the file.  For
correct results, this must be the one for the widest possible mode
(`HImode', here).  If the pattern matches the `QImode' instruction, the
results will be incorrect if the constant value does not actually fit
that mode.

   Such instructions to extend constants are rarely generated because
they are optimized away, but they do occasionally happen in nonoptimized
compilations.

   If a constraint in a pattern allows a constant, the reload pass may
replace a register with a constant permitted by the constraint in some
cases.  Similarly for memory references.  You must ensure that the
predicate permits all objects allowed by the constraints to prevent the
compiler from crashing.

   Because of this substitution, you should not provide separate
patterns for increment and decrement instructions.  Instead, they
should be generated from the same pattern that supports
register-register add insns by examining the operands and generating
the appropriate machine instruction.




Defining Jump Instruction Patterns
==================================

   For most machines, GNU CC assumes that the machine has a condition
code.  A comparison insn sets the condition code, recording the results
of both signed and unsigned comparison of the given operands.  A
separate branch insn tests the condition code and branches or not
according its value.  The branch insns come in distinct signed and
unsigned flavors.  Many common machines, such as the Vax, the 68000 and
the 32000, work this way.

   Some machines have distinct signed and unsigned compare
instructions, and only one set of conditional branch instructions.  The
easiest way to handle these machines is to treat them just like the
others until the final stage where assembly code is written.  At this
time, when outputting code for the compare instruction, peek ahead at
the following branch using `next_cc0_user (insn)'.  (The variable
`insn' refers to the insn being output, in the output-writing code in
an instruction pattern.)  If the RTL says that is an unsigned branch,
output an unsigned compare; otherwise output a signed compare.  When
the branch itself is output, you can treat signed and unsigned branches
identically.

   The reason you can do this is that GNU CC always generates a pair of
consecutive RTL insns, possibly separated by `note' insns, one to set
the condition code and one to test it, and keeps the pair inviolate
until the end.

   To go with this technique, you must define the machine-description
macro `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' to do `CC_STATUS_INIT'; in other words, no
compare instruction is superfluous.

   Some machines have compare-and-branch instructions and no condition
code.  A similar technique works for them.  When it is time to "output"
a compare instruction, record its operands in two static variables.
When outputting the branch-on-condition-code instruction that follows,
actually output a compare-and-branch instruction that uses the
remembered operands.

   It also works to define patterns for compare-and-branch instructions.
In optimizing compilation, the pair of compare and branch instructions
will be combined according to these patterns.  But this does not happen
if optimization is not requested.  So you must use one of the solutions
above in addition to any special patterns you define.

   In many RISC machines, most instructions do not affect the condition
code and there may not even be a separate condition code register.  On
these machines, the restriction that the definition and use of the
condition code be adjacent insns is not necessary and can prevent
important optimizations.  For example, on the IBM RS/6000, there is a
delay for taken branches unless the condition code register is set three
instructions earlier than the conditional branch.  The instruction
scheduler cannot perform this optimization if it is not permitted to
separate the definition and use of the condition code register.

   On these machines, do not use `(cc0)', but instead use a register to
represent the condition code.  If there is a specific condition code
register in the machine, use a hard register.  If the condition code or
comparison result can be placed in any general register, or if there are
multiple condition registers, use a pseudo register.

   On some machines, the type of branch instruction generated may
depend on the way the condition code was produced; for example, on the
68k and Sparc, setting the condition code directly from an add or
subtract instruction does not clear the overflow bit the way that a test
instruction does, so a different branch instruction must be used for
some conditional branches.  For machines that use `(cc0)', the set and
use of the condition code must be adjacent (separated only by `note'
insns) allowing flags in `cc_status' to be used.  (*Note Condition
Code::.)  Also, the comparison and branch insns can be located from
each other by using the functions `prev_cc0_setter' and `next_cc0_user'.

   However, this is not true on machines that do not use `(cc0)'.  On
those machines, no assumptions can be made about the adjacency of the
compare and branch insns and the above methods cannot be used.  Instead,
we use the machine mode of the condition code register to record
different formats of the condition code register.

   Registers used to store the condition code value should have a mode
that is in class `MODE_CC'.  Normally, it will be `CCmode'.  If
additional modes are required (as for the add example mentioned above in
the Sparc), define the macro `EXTRA_CC_MODES' to list the additional
modes required (*note Condition Code::.).  Also define `EXTRA_CC_NAMES'
to list the names of those modes and `SELECT_CC_MODE' to choose a mode
given an operand of a compare.

   If it is known during RTL generation that a different mode will be
required (for example, if the machine has separate compare instructions
for signed and unsigned quantities, like most IBM processors), they can
be specified at that time.

   If the cases that require different modes would be made by
instruction combination, the macro `SELECT_CC_MODE' determines which
machine mode should be used for the comparison result.  The patterns
should be written using that mode.  To support the case of the add on
the Sparc discussed above, we have the pattern

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (reg:CC_NOOV 0)
             (compare:CC_NOOV
               (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "%r")
                        (match_operand:SI 1 "arith_operand" "rI"))
               (const_int 0)))]
       ""
       "...")

   The `SELECT_CC_MODE' macro on the Sparc returns `CC_NOOVmode' for
comparisons whose argument is a `plus'.




Canonicalization of Instructions
================================

   There are often cases where multiple RTL expressions could represent
an operation performed by a single machine instruction.  This situation
is most commonly encountered with logical, branch, and
multiply-accumulate instructions.  In such cases, the compiler attempts
to convert these multiple RTL expressions into a single canonical form
to reduce the number of insn patterns required.

   In addition to algebraic simplifications, following canonicalizations
are performed:

   * For commutative and comparison operators, a constant is always
     made the second operand.  If a machine only supports a constant as
     the second operand, only patterns that match a constant in the
     second operand need be supplied.

     For these operators, if only one operand is a `neg', `not',
     `mult', `plus', or `minus' expression, it will be the first
     operand.

   * For the `compare' operator, a constant is always the second operand
     on machines where `cc0' is used (*note Jump Patterns::.).  On other
     machines, there are rare cases where the compiler might want to
     construct a `compare' with a constant as the first operand.
     However, these cases are not common enough for it to be worthwhile
     to provide a pattern matching a constant as the first operand
     unless the machine actually has such an instruction.

     An operand of `neg', `not', `mult', `plus', or `minus' is made the
     first operand under the same conditions as above.

   * `(minus X (const_int N))' is converted to `(plus X (const_int
     -N))'.

   * Within address computations (i.e., inside `mem'), a left shift is
     converted into the appropriate multiplication by a power of two.

     De`Morgan's Law is used to move bitwise negation inside a bitwise
     logical-and or logical-or operation.  If this results in only one
     operand being a `not' expression, it will be the first one.

     A machine that has an instruction that performs a bitwise
     logical-and of one operand with the bitwise negation of the other
     should specify the pattern for that instruction as

          (define_insn ""
            [(set (match_operand:M 0 ...)
                  (and:M (not:M (match_operand:M 1 ...))
                               (match_operand:M 2 ...)))]
            "..."
            "...")

     Similarly, a pattern for a "NAND" instruction should be written

          (define_insn ""
            [(set (match_operand:M 0 ...)
                  (ior:M (not:M (match_operand:M 1 ...))
                               (not:M (match_operand:M 2 ...))))]
            "..."
            "...")

     In both cases, it is not necessary to include patterns for the many
     logically equivalent RTL expressions.

   * The only possible RTL expressions involving both bitwise
     exclusive-or and bitwise negation are `(xor:M X Y)' and `(not:M
     (xor:M X Y))'.

   * The sum of three items, one of which is a constant, will only
     appear in the form

          (plus:M (plus:M X Y) CONSTANT)

   * On machines that do not use `cc0', `(compare X (const_int 0))'
     will be converted to X.

   * Equality comparisons of a group of bits (usually a single bit)
     with zero will be written using `zero_extract' rather than the
     equivalent `and' or `sign_extract' operations.




Machine-Specific Peephole Optimizers
====================================

   In addition to instruction patterns the `md' file may contain
definitions of machine-specific peephole optimizations.

   The combiner does not notice certain peephole optimizations when the
data flow in the program does not suggest that it should try them.  For
example, sometimes two consecutive insns related in purpose can be
combined even though the second one does not appear to use a register
computed in the first one.  A machine-specific peephole optimizer can
detect such opportunities.

   A definition looks like this:

     (define_peephole
       [INSN-PATTERN-1
        INSN-PATTERN-2
        ...]
       "CONDITION"
       "TEMPLATE"
       "OPTIONAL INSN-ATTRIBUTES")

The last string operand may be omitted if you are not using any
machine-specific information in this machine description.  If present,
it must obey the same rules as in a `define_insn'.

   In this skeleton, INSN-PATTERN-1 and so on are patterns to match
consecutive insns.  The optimization applies to a sequence of insns when
INSN-PATTERN-1 matches the first one, INSN-PATTERN-2 matches the next,
and so on.

   Each of the insns matched by a peephole must also match a
`define_insn'.  Peepholes are checked only at the last stage just
before code generation, and only optionally.  Therefore, any insn which
would match a peephole but no `define_insn' will cause a crash in code
generation in an unoptimized compilation, or at various optimization
stages.

   The operands of the insns are matched with `match_operands',
`match_operator', and `match_dup', as usual.  What is not usual is that
the operand numbers apply to all the insn patterns in the definition.
So, you can check for identical operands in two insns by using
`match_operand' in one insn and `match_dup' in the other.

   The operand constraints used in `match_operand' patterns do not have
any direct effect on the applicability of the peephole, but they will
be validated afterward, so make sure your constraints are general enough
to apply whenever the peephole matches.  If the peephole matches but
the constraints are not satisfied, the compiler will crash.

   It is safe to omit constraints in all the operands of the peephole;
or you can write constraints which serve as a double-check on the
criteria previously tested.

   Once a sequence of insns matches the patterns, the CONDITION is
checked.  This is a C expression which makes the final decision whether
to perform the optimization (we do so if the expression is nonzero).  If
CONDITION is omitted (in other words, the string is empty) then the
optimization is applied to every sequence of insns that matches the
patterns.

   The defined peephole optimizations are applied after register
allocation is complete.  Therefore, the peephole definition can check
which operands have ended up in which kinds of registers, just by
looking at the operands.

   The way to refer to the operands in CONDITION is to write
`operands[I]' for operand number I (as matched by `(match_operand I
...)').  Use the variable `insn' to refer to the last of the insns
being matched; use `prev_nonnote_insn' to find the preceding insns.

   When optimizing computations with intermediate results, you can use
CONDITION to match only when the intermediate results are not used
elsewhere.  Use the C expression `dead_or_set_p (INSN, OP)', where INSN
is the insn in which you expect the value to be used for the last time
(from the value of `insn', together with use of `prev_nonnote_insn'),
and OP is the intermediate value (from `operands[I]').

   Applying the optimization means replacing the sequence of insns with
one new insn.  The TEMPLATE controls ultimate output of assembler code
for this combined insn.  It works exactly like the template of a
`define_insn'.  Operand numbers in this template are the same ones used
in matching the original sequence of insns.

   The result of a defined peephole optimizer does not need to match
any of the insn patterns in the machine description; it does not even
have an opportunity to match them.  The peephole optimizer definition
itself serves as the insn pattern to control how the insn is output.

   Defined peephole optimizers are run as assembler code is being
output, so the insns they produce are never combined or rearranged in
any way.

   Here is an example, taken from the 68000 machine description:

     (define_peephole
       [(set (reg:SI 15) (plus:SI (reg:SI 15) (const_int 4)))
        (set (match_operand:DF 0 "register_operand" "=f")
             (match_operand:DF 1 "register_operand" "ad"))]
       "FP_REG_P (operands[0]) && ! FP_REG_P (operands[1])"
       "*
     {
       rtx xoperands[2];
       xoperands[1] = gen_rtx (REG, SImode, REGNO (operands[1]) + 1);
     #ifdef MOTOROLA
       output_asm_insn (\"move.l %1,(sp)\", xoperands);
       output_asm_insn (\"move.l %1,-(sp)\", operands);
       return \"fmove.d (sp)+,%0\";
     #else
       output_asm_insn (\"movel %1,sp@\", xoperands);
       output_asm_insn (\"movel %1,sp@-\", operands);
       return \"fmoved sp@+,%0\";
     #endif
     }
     ")

   The effect of this optimization is to change

     jbsr _foobar
     addql #4,sp
     movel d1,sp@-
     movel d0,sp@-
     fmoved sp@+,fp0

into

     jbsr _foobar
     movel d1,sp@
     movel d0,sp@-
     fmoved sp@+,fp0

   INSN-PATTERN-1 and so on look *almost* like the second operand of
`define_insn'.  There is one important difference: the second operand
of `define_insn' consists of one or more RTX's enclosed in square
brackets.  Usually, there is only one: then the same action can be
written as an element of a `define_peephole'.  But when there are
multiple actions in a `define_insn', they are implicitly enclosed in a
`parallel'.  Then you must explicitly write the `parallel', and the
square brackets within it, in the `define_peephole'.  Thus, if an insn
pattern looks like this,

     (define_insn "divmodsi4"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=d")
             (div:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
                     (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "dmsK")))
        (set (match_operand:SI 3 "general_operand" "=d")
             (mod:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 2)))]
       "TARGET_68020"
       "divsl%.l %2,%3:%0")

then the way to mention this insn in a peephole is as follows:

     (define_peephole
       [...
        (parallel
         [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=d")
               (div:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
                       (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "dmsK")))
          (set (match_operand:SI 3 "general_operand" "=d")
               (mod:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 2)))])
        ...]
       ...)

Defining RTL Sequences for Code Generation
==========================================

   On some target machines, some standard pattern names for RTL
generation cannot be handled with single insn, but a sequence of RTL
insns can represent them.  For these target machines, you can write a
`define_expand' to specify how to generate the sequence of RTL.

   A `define_expand' is an RTL expression that looks almost like a
`define_insn'; but, unlike the latter, a `define_expand' is used only
for RTL generation and it can produce more than one RTL insn.

   A `define_expand' RTX has four operands:

   * The name.  Each `define_expand' must have a name, since the only
     use for it is to refer to it by name.

   * The RTL template.  This is just like the RTL template for a
     `define_peephole' in that it is a vector of RTL expressions each
     being one insn.

   * The condition, a string containing a C expression.  This
     expression is used to express how the availability of this pattern
     depends on subclasses of target machine, selected by command-line
     options when GNU CC is run.  This is just like the condition of a
     `define_insn' that has a standard name.

   * The preparation statements, a string containing zero or more C
     statements which are to be executed before RTL code is generated
     from the RTL template.

     Usually these statements prepare temporary registers for use as
     internal operands in the RTL template, but they can also generate
     RTL insns directly by calling routines such as `emit_insn', etc.
     Any such insns precede the ones that come from the RTL template.

   Every RTL insn emitted by a `define_expand' must match some
`define_insn' in the machine description.  Otherwise, the compiler will
crash when trying to generate code for the insn or trying to optimize
it.

   The RTL template, in addition to controlling generation of RTL insns,
also describes the operands that need to be specified when this pattern
is used.  In particular, it gives a predicate for each operand.

   A true operand, which needs to be specified in order to generate RTL
from the pattern, should be described with a `match_operand' in its
first occurrence in the RTL template.  This enters information on the
operand's predicate into the tables that record such things.  GNU CC
uses the information to preload the operand into a register if that is
required for valid RTL code.  If the operand is referred to more than
once, subsequent references should use `match_dup'.

   The RTL template may also refer to internal "operands" which are
temporary registers or labels used only within the sequence made by the
`define_expand'.  Internal operands are substituted into the RTL
template with `match_dup', never with `match_operand'.  The values of
the internal operands are not passed in as arguments by the compiler
when it requests use of this pattern.  Instead, they are computed
within the pattern, in the preparation statements.  These statements
compute the values and store them into the appropriate elements of
`operands' so that `match_dup' can find them.

   There are two special macros defined for use in the preparation
statements: `DONE' and `FAIL'.  Use them with a following semicolon, as
a statement.

`DONE'
     Use the `DONE' macro to end RTL generation for the pattern.  The
     only RTL insns resulting from the pattern on this occasion will be
     those already emitted by explicit calls to `emit_insn' within the
     preparation statements; the RTL template will not be generated.

`FAIL'
     Make the pattern fail on this occasion.  When a pattern fails, it
     means that the pattern was not truly available.  The calling
     routines in the compiler will try other strategies for code
     generation using other patterns.

     Failure is currently supported only for binary (addition,
     multiplication, shifting, etc.) and bitfield (`extv', `extzv', and
     `insv') operations.

   Here is an example, the definition of left-shift for the SPUR chip:

     (define_expand "ashlsi3"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
             (ashift:SI

     (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "")
               (match_operand:SI 2 "nonmemory_operand" "")))]
       ""
       "

     {
       if (GET_CODE (operands[2]) != CONST_INT
           || (unsigned) INTVAL (operands[2]) > 3)
         FAIL;
     }")

This example uses `define_expand' so that it can generate an RTL insn
for shifting when the shift-count is in the supported range of 0 to 3
but fail in other cases where machine insns aren't available.  When it
fails, the compiler tries another strategy using different patterns
(such as, a library call).

   If the compiler were able to handle nontrivial condition-strings in
patterns with names, then it would be possible to use a `define_insn'
in that case.  Here is another case (zero-extension on the 68000) which
makes more use of the power of `define_expand':

     (define_expand "zero_extendhisi2"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "")
             (const_int 0))
        (set (strict_low_part
               (subreg:HI
                 (match_dup 0)
                 0))
             (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" ""))]
       ""
       "operands[1] = make_safe_from (operands[1], operands[0]);")

Here two RTL insns are generated, one to clear the entire output operand
and the other to copy the input operand into its low half.  This
sequence is incorrect if the input operand refers to [the old value of]
the output operand, so the preparation statement makes sure this isn't
so.  The function `make_safe_from' copies the `operands[1]' into a
temporary register if it refers to `operands[0]'.  It does this by
emitting another RTL insn.

   Finally, a third example shows the use of an internal operand.
Zero-extension on the SPUR chip is done by `and'-ing the result against
a halfword mask.  But this mask cannot be represented by a `const_int'
because the constant value is too large to be legitimate on this
machine.  So it must be copied into a register with `force_reg' and
then the register used in the `and'.

     (define_expand "zero_extendhisi2"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
             (and:SI (subreg:SI
                       (match_operand:HI 1 "register_operand" "")
                       0)
                     (match_dup 2)))]
       ""
       "operands[2]
          = force_reg (SImode, gen_rtx (CONST_INT,
                                        VOIDmode, 65535)); ")

   *Note:* If the `define_expand' is used to serve a standard binary or
unary arithmetic operation or a bitfield operation, then the last insn
it generates must not be a `code_label', `barrier' or `note'.  It must
be an `insn', `jump_insn' or `call_insn'.  If you don't need a real insn
at the end, emit an insn to copy the result of the operation into
itself.  Such an insn will generate no code, but it can avoid problems
in the compiler.




Defining How to Split Instructions
==================================

   There are two cases where you should specify how to split a pattern
into multiple insns.  On machines that have instructions requiring delay
slots (*note Delay Slots::.) or that have instructions whose output is
not available for multiple cycles (*note Function Units::.), the
compiler phases that optimize these cases need to be able to move insns
into one-instruction delay slots.  However, some insns may generate
more than one machine instruction.  These insns cannot be placed into a
delay slot.

   Often you can rewrite the single insn as a list of individual insns,
each corresponding to one machine instruction.  The disadvantage of
doing so is that it will cause the compilation to be slower and require
more space.  If the resulting insns are too complex, it may also
suppress some optimizations.  The compiler splits the insn if there is a
reason to believe that it might improve instruction or delay slot
scheduling.

   The insn combiner phase also splits putative insns.  If three insns
are merged into one insn with a complex expression that cannot be
matched by some `define_insn' pattern, the combiner phase attempts to
split the complex pattern into two insns that are recognized.  Usually
it can break the complex pattern into two patterns by splitting out some
subexpression.  However, in some other cases, such as performing an
addition of a large constant in two insns on a RISC machine, the way to
split the addition into two insns is machine-dependent.

   The `define_split' definition tells the compiler how to split a
complex insn into several simpler insns.  It looks like this:

     (define_split
       [INSN-PATTERN]
       "CONDITION"
       [NEW-INSN-PATTERN-1
        NEW-INSN-PATTERN-2
        ...]
       "PREPARATION STATEMENTS")

   INSN-PATTERN is a pattern that needs to be split and CONDITION is
the final condition to be tested, as in a `define_insn'.  When an insn
matching INSN-PATTERN and satisfying CONDITION is found, it is replaced
in the insn list with the insns given by NEW-INSN-PATTERN-1,
NEW-INSN-PATTERN-2, etc.

   The PREPARATION STATEMENTS are similar to those statements that are
specified for `define_expand' (*note Expander Definitions::.) and are
executed before the new RTL is generated to prepare for the generated
code or emit some insns whose pattern is not fixed.  Unlike those in
`define_expand', however, these statements must not generate any new
pseudo-registers.  Once reload has completed, they also must not
allocate any space in the stack frame.

   Patterns are matched against INSN-PATTERN in two different
circumstances.  If an insn needs to be split for delay slot scheduling
or insn scheduling, the insn is already known to be valid, which means
that it must have been matched by some `define_insn' and, if
`reload_completed' is non-zero, is known to satisfy the constraints of
that `define_insn'.  In that case, the new insn patterns must also be
insns that are matched by some `define_insn' and, if `reload_completed'
is non-zero, must also satisfy the constraints of those definitions.

   As an example of this usage of `define_split', consider the following
example from `a29k.md', which splits a `sign_extend' from `HImode' to
`SImode' into a pair of shift insns:

     (define_split
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "gen_reg_operand" "")
             (sign_extend:SI (match_operand:HI 1 "gen_reg_operand"
"")))]
       ""
       [(set (match_dup 0)
             (ashift:SI (match_dup 1)
                        (const_int 16)))
        (set (match_dup 0)
             (ashiftrt:SI (match_dup 0)
                          (const_int 16)))]
       "
     { operands[1] = gen_lowpart (SImode, operands[1]); }")

   When the combiner phase tries to split an insn pattern, it is always
the case that the pattern is *not* matched by any `define_insn'.  The
combiner pass first tries to split a single `set' expression and then
the same `set' expression inside a `parallel', but followed by a
`clobber' of a pseudo-reg to use as a scratch register.  In these
cases, the combiner expects exactly two new insn patterns to be
generated.  It will verify that these patterns match some `define_insn'
definitions, so you need not do this test in the `define_split' (of
course, there is no point in writing a `define_split' that will never
produce insns that match).

   Here is an example of this use of `define_split', taken from
`rs6000.md':

     (define_split
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "gen_reg_operand" "")
             (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "gen_reg_operand" "")
                      (match_operand:SI 2 "non_add_cint_operand" "")))]
       ""
       [(set (match_dup 0) (plus:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 3)))
        (set (match_dup 0) (plus:SI (match_dup 0) (match_dup 4)))]
     "
     {
       int low = INTVAL (operands[2]) & 0xffff;
       int high = (unsigned) INTVAL (operands[2]) >> 16;

       if (low & 0x8000)
         high++, low |= 0xffff0000;

       operands[3] = gen_rtx (CONST_INT, VOIDmode, high << 16);
       operands[4] = gen_rtx (CONST_INT, VOIDmode, low);
     }")

   Here the predicate `non_add_cint_operand' matches any `const_int'
that is *not* a valid operand of a single add insn.  The add with the
smaller displacement is written so that it can be substituted into the
address of a subsequent operation.

   An example that uses a scratch register, from the same file,
generates an equality comparison of a register and a large constant:

     (define_split
       [(set (match_operand:CC 0 "cc_reg_operand" "")
             (compare:CC (match_operand:SI 1 "gen_reg_operand" "")
                         (match_operand:SI 2 "non_short_cint_operand"
"")))
        (clobber (match_operand:SI 3 "gen_reg_operand" ""))]
       "find_single_use (operands[0], insn, 0)
        && (GET_CODE (*find_single_use (operands[0], insn, 0)) == EQ
            || GET_CODE (*find_single_use (operands[0], insn, 0)) ==
NE)"
       [(set (match_dup 3) (xor:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 4)))
        (set (match_dup 0) (compare:CC (match_dup 3) (match_dup 5)))]
       "
     {
       /* Get the constant we are comparing against, C, and see what it
          looks like sign-extended to 16 bits.  Then see what constant
          could be XOR'ed with C to get the sign-extended value.  */

       int c = INTVAL (operands[2]);
       int sextc = (c << 16) >> 16;
       int xorv = c ^ sextc;

       operands[4] = gen_rtx (CONST_INT, VOIDmode, xorv);
       operands[5] = gen_rtx (CONST_INT, VOIDmode, sextc);
     }")

   To avoid confusion, don't write a single `define_split' that accepts
some insns that match some `define_insn' as well as some insns that
don't.  Instead, write two separate `define_split' definitions, one for
the insns that are valid and one for the insns that are not valid.




Instruction Attributes
======================

   In addition to describing the instruction supported by the target
machine, the `md' file also defines a group of "attributes" and a set of
values for each.  Every generated insn is assigned a value for each
attribute.  One possible attribute would be the effect that the insn
has on the machine's condition code.  This attribute can then be used
by `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' to track the condition codes.


Defining Attributes and their Values
------------------------------------

   The `define_attr' expression is used to define each attribute
required by the target machine.  It looks like:

     (define_attr NAME LIST-OF-VALUES DEFAULT)

   NAME is a string specifying the name of the attribute being defined.

   LIST-OF-VALUES is either a string that specifies a comma-separated
list of values that can be assigned to the attribute, or a null string
to indicate that the attribute takes numeric values.

   DEFAULT is an attribute expression that gives the value of this
attribute for insns that match patterns whose definition does not
include an explicit value for this attribute.  *Note Attr Example::,
for more information on the handling of defaults.  *Note Constant
Attributes::, for information on attributes that do not depend on any
particular insn.

   For each defined attribute, a number of definitions are written to
the `insn-attr.h' file.  For cases where an explicit set of values is
specified for an attribute, the following are defined:

   * A `#define' is written for the symbol `HAVE_ATTR_NAME'.

   * An enumeral class is defined for `attr_NAME' with elements of the
     form `UPPER-NAME_UPPER-VALUE' where the attribute name and value
     are first converted to upper case.

   * A function `get_attr_NAME' is defined that is passed an insn and
     returns the attribute value for that insn.

   For example, if the following is present in the `md' file:

     (define_attr "type" "branch,fp,load,store,arith" ...)

the following lines will be written to the file `insn-attr.h'.

     #define HAVE_ATTR_type
     enum attr_type {TYPE_BRANCH, TYPE_FP, TYPE_LOAD,
                      TYPE_STORE, TYPE_ARITH};
     extern enum attr_type get_attr_type ();

   If the attribute takes numeric values, no `enum' type will be
defined and the function to obtain the attribute's value will return
`int'.




Attribute Expressions
---------------------

   RTL expressions used to define attributes use the codes described
above plus a few specific to attribute definitions, to be discussed
below.  Attribute value expressions must have one of the following
forms:

`(const_int I)'
     The integer I specifies the value of a numeric attribute.  I must
     be non-negative.

     The value of a numeric attribute can be specified either with a
     `const_int' or as an integer represented as a string in
     `const_string', `eq_attr' (see below), and `set_attr' (*note
     Tagging Insns::.) expressions.

`(const_string VALUE)'
     The string VALUE specifies a constant attribute value.  If VALUE
     is specified as `"*"', it means that the default value of the
     attribute is to be used for the insn containing this expression.
     `"*"' obviously cannot be used in the DEFAULT expression of a
     `define_attr'.

     If the attribute whose value is being specified is numeric, VALUE
     must be a string containing a non-negative integer (normally
     `const_int' would be used in this case).  Otherwise, it must
     contain one of the valid values for the attribute.

`(if_then_else TEST TRUE-VALUE FALSE-VALUE)'
     TEST specifies an attribute test, whose format is defined below.
     The value of this expression is TRUE-VALUE if TEST is true,
     otherwise it is FALSE-VALUE.

`(cond [TEST1 VALUE1 ...] DEFAULT)'
     The first operand of this expression is a vector containing an even
     number of expressions and consisting of pairs of TEST and VALUE
     expressions.  The value of the `cond' expression is that of the
     VALUE corresponding to the first true TEST expression.  If none of
     the TEST expressions are true, the value of the `cond' expression
     is that of the DEFAULT expression.

   TEST expressions can have one of the following forms:

`(const_int I)'
     This test is true if I is non-zero and false otherwise.

`(not TEST)'
`(ior TEST1 TEST2)'
`(and TEST1 TEST2)'
     These tests are true if the indicated logical function is true.

`(match_operand:M N PRED CONSTRAINTS)'
     This test is true if operand N of the insn whose attribute value
     is being determined has mode M (this part of the test is ignored
     if M is `VOIDmode') and the function specified by the string PRED
     returns a non-zero value when passed operand N and mode M (this
     part of the test is ignored if PRED is the null string).

     The CONSTRAINTS operand is ignored and should be the null string.

`(le ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(leu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(lt ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(ltu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(gt ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(gtu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(ge ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(geu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(ne ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(eq ARITH1 ARITH2)'
     These tests are true if the indicated comparison of the two
     arithmetic expressions is true.  Arithmetic expressions are formed
     with `plus', `minus', `mult', `div', `mod', `abs', `neg', `and',
     `ior', `xor', `not', `ashift', `lshiftrt', and `ashiftrt'
     expressions.

     `const_int' and `symbol_ref' are always valid terms (*note Insn
     Lengths::.,for additional forms).  `symbol_ref' is a string
     denoting a C expression that yields an `int' when evaluated by the
     `get_attr_...' routine.  It should normally be a global variable.

`(eq_attr NAME VALUE)'
     NAME is a string specifying the name of an attribute.

     VALUE is a string that is either a valid value for attribute NAME,
     a comma-separated list of values, or `!' followed by a value or
     list.  If VALUE does not begin with a `!', this test is true if
     the value of the NAME attribute of the current insn is in the list
     specified by VALUE.  If VALUE begins with a `!', this test is true
     if the attribute's value is *not* in the specified list.

     For example,

          (eq_attr "type" "load,store")

     is equivalent to

          (ior (eq_attr "type" "load") (eq_attr "type" "store"))

     If NAME specifies an attribute of `alternative', it refers to the
     value of the compiler variable `which_alternative' (*note Output
     Statement::.) and the values must be small integers.  For example,

          (eq_attr "alternative" "2,3")

     is equivalent to

          (ior (eq (symbol_ref "which_alternative") (const_int 2))
               (eq (symbol_ref "which_alternative") (const_int 3)))

     Note that, for most attributes, an `eq_attr' test is simplified in
     cases where the value of the attribute being tested is known for
     all insns matching a particular pattern.  This is by far the most
     common case.

`(attr_flag NAME)'
     The value of an `attr_flag' expression is true if the flag
     specified by NAME is true for the `insn' currently being scheduled.

     NAME is a string specifying one of a fixed set of flags to test.
     Test the flags `forward' and `backward' to determine the direction
     of a conditional branch.  Test the flags `very_likely', `likely',
     `very_unlikely', and `unlikely' to determine if a conditional
     branch is expected to be taken.

     If the `very_likely' flag is true, then the `likely' flag is also
     true.  Likewise for the `very_unlikely' and `unlikely' flags.

     This example describes a conditional branch delay slot which can
     be nullified for forward branches that are taken (annul-true) or
     for backward branches which are not taken (annul-false).

          (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "cbranch")
            [(eq_attr "in_branch_delay" "true")
             (and (eq_attr "in_branch_delay" "true")
                  (attr_flag "forward"))
             (and (eq_attr "in_branch_delay" "true")
                  (attr_flag "backward"))])

     The `forward' and `backward' flags are false if the current `insn'
     being scheduled is not a conditional branch.

     The `very_likely' and `likely' flags are true if the `insn' being
     scheduled is not a conditional branch.  The The `very_unlikely'
     and `unlikely' flags are false if the `insn' being scheduled is
     not a conditional branch.

     `attr_flag' is only used during delay slot scheduling and has no
     meaning to other passes of the compiler.




Assigning Attribute Values to Insns
-----------------------------------

   The value assigned to an attribute of an insn is primarily
determined by which pattern is matched by that insn (or which
`define_peephole' generated it).  Every `define_insn' and
`define_peephole' can have an optional last argument to specify the
values of attributes for matching insns.  The value of any attribute
not specified in a particular insn is set to the default value for that
attribute, as specified in its `define_attr'.  Extensive use of default
values for attributes permits the specification of the values for only
one or two attributes in the definition of most insn patterns, as seen
in the example in the next section.

   The optional last argument of `define_insn' and `define_peephole' is
a vector of expressions, each of which defines the value for a single
attribute.  The most general way of assigning an attribute's value is
to use a `set' expression whose first operand is an `attr' expression
giving the name of the attribute being set.  The second operand of the
`set' is an attribute expression (*note Expressions::.) giving the
value of the attribute.

   When the attribute value depends on the `alternative' attribute
(i.e., which is the applicable alternative in the constraint of the
insn), the `set_attr_alternative' expression can be used.  It allows
the specification of a vector of attribute expressions, one for each
alternative.

   When the generality of arbitrary attribute expressions is not
required, the simpler `set_attr' expression can be used, which allows
specifying a string giving either a single attribute value or a list of
attribute values, one for each alternative.

   The form of each of the above specifications is shown below.  In
each case, NAME is a string specifying the attribute to be set.

`(set_attr NAME VALUE-STRING)'
     VALUE-STRING is either a string giving the desired attribute value,
     or a string containing a comma-separated list giving the values for
     succeeding alternatives.  The number of elements must match the
     number of alternatives in the constraint of the insn pattern.

     Note that it may be useful to specify `*' for some alternative, in
     which case the attribute will assume its default value for insns
     matching that alternative.

`(set_attr_alternative NAME [VALUE1 VALUE2 ...])'
     Depending on the alternative of the insn, the value will be one of
     the specified values.  This is a shorthand for using a `cond' with
     tests on the `alternative' attribute.

`(set (attr NAME) VALUE)'
     The first operand of this `set' must be the special RTL expression
     `attr', whose sole operand is a string giving the name of the
     attribute being set.  VALUE is the value of the attribute.

   The following shows three different ways of representing the same
attribute value specification:

     (set_attr "type" "load,store,arith")

     (set_attr_alternative "type"
                           [(const_string "load") (const_string "store")
                            (const_string "arith")])

     (set (attr "type")
          (cond [(eq_attr "alternative" "1") (const_string "load")
                 (eq_attr "alternative" "2") (const_string "store")]
                (const_string "arith")))

   The `define_asm_attributes' expression provides a mechanism to
specify the attributes assigned to insns produced from an `asm'
statement.  It has the form:

     (define_asm_attributes [ATTR-SETS])

where ATTR-SETS is specified the same as for both the `define_insn' and
the `define_peephole' expressions.

   These values will typically be the "worst case" attribute values.
For example, they might indicate that the condition code will be
clobbered.

   A specification for a `length' attribute is handled specially.  The
way to compute the length of an `asm' insn is to multiply the length
specified in the expression `define_asm_attributes' by the number of
machine instructions specified in the `asm' statement, determined by
counting the number of semicolons and newlines in the string.
Therefore, the value of the `length' attribute specified in a
`define_asm_attributes' should be the maximum possible length of a
single machine instruction.




Example of Attribute Specifications
-----------------------------------

   The judicious use of defaulting is important in the efficient use of
insn attributes.  Typically, insns are divided into "types" and an
attribute, customarily called `type', is used to represent this value.
This attribute is normally used only to define the default value for
other attributes.  An example will clarify this usage.

   Assume we have a RISC machine with a condition code and in which only
full-word operations are performed in registers.  Let us assume that we
can divide all insns into loads, stores, (integer) arithmetic
operations, floating point operations, and branches.

   Here we will concern ourselves with determining the effect of an
insn on the condition code and will limit ourselves to the following
possible effects:  The condition code can be set unpredictably
(clobbered), not be changed, be set to agree with the results of the
operation, or only changed if the item previously set into the
condition code has been modified.

   Here is part of a sample `md' file for such a machine:

     (define_attr "type" "load,store,arith,fp,branch" (const_string
"arith"))

     (define_attr "cc" "clobber,unchanged,set,change0"
                  (cond [(eq_attr "type" "load")
                             (const_string "change0")
                         (eq_attr "type" "store,branch")
                             (const_string "unchanged")
                         (eq_attr "type" "arith")
                             (if_then_else (match_operand:SI 0 "" "")
                                           (const_string "set")
                                           (const_string "clobber"))]
                        (const_string "clobber")))

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,r,m")
             (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "r,m,r"))]
       ""
       "@
        move %0,%1
        load %0,%1
        store %0,%1"
       [(set_attr "type" "arith,load,store")])

   Note that we assume in the above example that arithmetic operations
performed on quantities smaller than a machine word clobber the
condition code since they will set the condition code to a value
corresponding to the full-word result.




Computing the Length of an Insn
-------------------------------

   For many machines, multiple types of branch instructions are
provided, each for different length branch displacements.  In most
cases, the assembler will choose the correct instruction to use.
However, when the assembler cannot do so, GCC can when a special
attribute, the `length' attribute, is defined.  This attribute must be
defined to have numeric values by specifying a null string in its
`define_attr'.

   In the case of the `length' attribute, two additional forms of
arithmetic terms are allowed in test expressions:

`(match_dup N)'
     This refers to the address of operand N of the current insn, which
     must be a `label_ref'.

`(pc)'
     This refers to the address of the *current* insn.  It might have
     been more consistent with other usage to make this the address of
     the *next* insn but this would be confusing because the length of
     the current insn is to be computed.

   For normal insns, the length will be determined by value of the
`length' attribute.  In the case of `addr_vec' and `addr_diff_vec' insn
patterns, the length is computed as the number of vectors multiplied by
the size of each vector.

   Lengths are measured in addressable storage units (bytes).

   The following macros can be used to refine the length computation:

`FIRST_INSN_ADDRESS'
     When the `length' insn attribute is used, this macro specifies the
     value to be assigned to the address of the first insn in a
     function.  If not specified, 0 is used.

`ADJUST_INSN_LENGTH (INSN, LENGTH)'
     If defined, modifies the length assigned to instruction INSN as a
     function of the context in which it is used.  LENGTH is an lvalue
     that contains the initially computed length of the insn and should
     be updated with the correct length of the insn.  If updating is
     required, INSN must not be a varying-length insn.

     This macro will normally not be required.  A case in which it is
     required is the ROMP.  On this machine, the size of an `addr_vec'
     insn must be increased by two to compensate for the fact that
     alignment may be required.

   The routine that returns `get_attr_length' (the value of the
`length' attribute) can be used by the output routine to determine the
form of the branch instruction to be written, as the example below
illustrates.

   As an example of the specification of variable-length branches,
consider the IBM 360.  If we adopt the convention that a register will
be set to the starting address of a function, we can jump to labels
within 4k of the start using a four-byte instruction.  Otherwise, we
need a six-byte sequence to load the address from memory and then
branch to it.

   On such a machine, a pattern for a branch instruction might be
specified as follows:

     (define_insn "jump"
       [(set (pc)
             (label_ref (match_operand 0 "" "")))]
       ""
       "*
     {
        return (get_attr_length (insn) == 4
                ? \"b %l0\" : \"l r15,=a(%l0); br r15\");
     }"
       [(set (attr "length") (if_then_else (lt (match_dup 0) (const_int
4096))
                                           (const_int 4)
                                           (const_int 6)))])




Constant Attributes
-------------------

   A special form of `define_attr', where the expression for the
default value is a `const' expression, indicates an attribute that is
constant for a given run of the compiler.  Constant attributes may be
used to specify which variety of processor is used.  For example,

     (define_attr "cpu" "m88100,m88110,m88000"
      (const
       (cond [(symbol_ref "TARGET_88100") (const_string "m88100")
              (symbol_ref "TARGET_88110") (const_string "m88110")]
             (const_string "m88000"))))

     (define_attr "memory" "fast,slow"
      (const
       (if_then_else (symbol_ref "TARGET_FAST_MEM")
                     (const_string "fast")
                     (const_string "slow"))))

   The routine generated for constant attributes has no parameters as it
does not depend on any particular insn.  RTL expressions used to define
the value of a constant attribute may use the `symbol_ref' form, but
may not use either the `match_operand' form or `eq_attr' forms
involving insn attributes.




Delay Slot Scheduling
---------------------

   The insn attribute mechanism can be used to specify the requirements
for delay slots, if any, on a target machine.  An instruction is said to
require a "delay slot" if some instructions that are physically after
the instruction are executed as if they were located before it.
Classic examples are branch and call instructions, which often execute
the following instruction before the branch or call is performed.

   On some machines, conditional branch instructions can optionally
"annul" instructions in the delay slot.  This means that the
instruction will not be executed for certain branch outcomes.  Both
instructions that annul if the branch is true and instructions that
annul if the branch is false are supported.

   Delay slot scheduling differs from instruction scheduling in that
determining whether an instruction needs a delay slot is dependent only
on the type of instruction being generated, not on data flow between the
instructions.  See the next section for a discussion of data-dependent
instruction scheduling.

   The requirement of an insn needing one or more delay slots is
indicated via the `define_delay' expression.  It has the following form:

     (define_delay TEST
                   [DELAY-1 ANNUL-TRUE-1 ANNUL-FALSE-1
                    DELAY-2 ANNUL-TRUE-2 ANNUL-FALSE-2
                    ...])

   TEST is an attribute test that indicates whether this `define_delay'
applies to a particular insn.  If so, the number of required delay
slots is determined by the length of the vector specified as the second
argument.  An insn placed in delay slot N must satisfy attribute test
DELAY-N.  ANNUL-TRUE-N is an attribute test that specifies which insns
may be annulled if the branch is true.  Similarly, ANNUL-FALSE-N
specifies which insns in the delay slot may be annulled if the branch
is false.  If annulling is not supported for that delay slot, `(nil)'
should be coded.

   For example, in the common case where branch and call insns require
a single delay slot, which may contain any insn other than a branch or
call, the following would be placed in the `md' file:

     (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "branch,call")
                   [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)])

   Multiple `define_delay' expressions may be specified.  In this case,
each such expression specifies different delay slot requirements and
there must be no insn for which tests in two `define_delay' expressions
are both true.

   For example, if we have a machine that requires one delay slot for
branches but two for calls,  no delay slot can contain a branch or call
insn, and any valid insn in the delay slot for the branch can be
annulled if the branch is true, we might represent this as follows:

     (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "branch")
        [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call")
         (eq_attr "type" "!branch,call")
         (nil)])

     (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "call")
                   [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)
                    (eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)])




Specifying Function Units
-------------------------

   On most RISC machines, there are instructions whose results are not
available for a specific number of cycles.  Common cases are
instructions that load data from memory.  On many machines, a pipeline
stall will result if the data is referenced too soon after the load
instruction.

   In addition, many newer microprocessors have multiple function
units, usually one for integer and one for floating point, and often
will incur pipeline stalls when a result that is needed is not yet
ready.

   The descriptions in this section allow the specification of how much
time must elapse between the execution of an instruction and the time
when its result is used.  It also allows specification of when the
execution of an instruction will delay execution of similar instructions
due to function unit conflicts.

   For the purposes of the specifications in this section, a machine is
divided into "function units", each of which execute a specific class
of instructions in first-in-first-out order.  Function units that
accept one instruction each cycle and allow a result to be used in the
succeeding instruction (usually via forwarding) need not be specified.
Classic RISC microprocessors will normally have a single function unit,
which we can call `memory'.  The newer "superscalar" processors will
often have function units for floating point operations, usually at
least a floating point adder and multiplier.

   Each usage of a function units by a class of insns is specified with
a `define_function_unit' expression, which looks like this:

     (define_function_unit NAME MULTIPLICITY SIMULTANEITY
                           TEST READY-DELAY ISSUE-DELAY
                          [CONFLICT-LIST])

   NAME is a string giving the name of the function unit.

   MULTIPLICITY is an integer specifying the number of identical units
in the processor.  If more than one unit is specified, they will be
scheduled independently.  Only truly independent units should be
counted; a pipelined unit should be specified as a single unit.  (The
only common example of a machine that has multiple function units for a
single instruction class that are truly independent and not pipelined
are the two multiply and two increment units of the CDC 6600.)

   SIMULTANEITY specifies the maximum number of insns that can be
executing in each instance of the function unit simultaneously or zero
if the unit is pipelined and has no limit.

   All `define_function_unit' definitions referring to function unit
NAME must have the same name and values for MULTIPLICITY and
SIMULTANEITY.

   TEST is an attribute test that selects the insns we are describing
in this definition.  Note that an insn may use more than one function
unit and a function unit may be specified in more than one
`define_function_unit'.

   READY-DELAY is an integer that specifies the number of cycles after
which the result of the instruction can be used without introducing any
stalls.

   ISSUE-DELAY is an integer that specifies the number of cycles after
the instruction matching the TEST expression begins using this unit
until a subsequent instruction can begin.  A cost of N indicates an N-1
cycle delay.  A subsequent instruction may also be delayed if an
earlier instruction has a longer READY-DELAY value.  This blocking
effect is computed using the SIMULTANEITY, READY-DELAY, ISSUE-DELAY,
and CONFLICT-LIST terms.  For a normal non-pipelined function unit,
SIMULTANEITY is one, the unit is taken to block for the READY-DELAY
cycles of the executing insn, and smaller values of ISSUE-DELAY are
ignored.

   CONFLICT-LIST is an optional list giving detailed conflict costs for
this unit.  If specified, it is a list of condition test expressions to
be applied to insns chosen to execute in NAME following the particular
insn matching TEST that is already executing in NAME.  For each insn in
the list, ISSUE-DELAY specifies the conflict cost; for insns not in the
list, the cost is zero.  If not specified, CONFLICT-LIST defaults to
all instructions that use the function unit.

   Typical uses of this vector are where a floating point function unit
can pipeline either single- or double-precision operations, but not
both, or where a memory unit can pipeline loads, but not stores, etc.

   As an example, consider a classic RISC machine where the result of a
load instruction is not available for two cycles (a single "delay"
instruction is required) and where only one load instruction can be
executed simultaneously.  This would be specified as:

     (define_function_unit "memory" 1 1 (eq_attr "type" "load") 2 0)

   For the case of a floating point function unit that can pipeline
either single or double precision, but not both, the following could be
specified:

     (define_function_unit
        "fp" 1 0 (eq_attr "type" "sp_fp") 4 4 [(eq_attr "type"
"dp_fp")])
     (define_function_unit
        "fp" 1 0 (eq_attr "type" "dp_fp") 4 4 [(eq_attr "type"
"sp_fp")])

   *Note:* The scheduler attempts to avoid function unit conflicts and
uses all the specifications in the `define_function_unit' expression.
It has recently come to our attention that these specifications may not
allow modeling of some of the newer "superscalar" processors that have
insns using multiple pipelined units.  These insns will cause a
potential conflict for the second unit used during their execution and
there is no way of representing that conflict.  We welcome any examples
of how function unit conflicts work in such processors and suggestions
for their representation.




Target Description Macros
*************************

   In addition to the file `MACHINE.md', a machine description includes
a C header file conventionally given the name `MACHINE.h'.  This header
file defines numerous macros that convey the information about the
target machine that does not fit into the scheme of the `.md' file.
The file `tm.h' should be a link to `MACHINE.h'.  The header file
`config.h' includes `tm.h' and most compiler source files include
`config.h'.



Controlling the Compilation Driver, `gcc'
=========================================

   You can control the compilation driver.

`SWITCH_TAKES_ARG (CHAR)'
     A C expression which determines whether the option `-CHAR' takes
     arguments.  The value should be the number of arguments that
     option takes-zero, for many options.

     By default, this macro is defined to handle the standard options
     properly.  You need not define it unless you wish to add additional
     options which take arguments.

`WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG (NAME)'
     A C expression which determines whether the option `-NAME' takes
     arguments.  The value should be the number of arguments that
     option takes-zero, for many options.  This macro rather than
     `SWITCH_TAKES_ARG' is used for multi-character option names.

     By default, this macro is defined as
     `DEFAULT_WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG', which handles the standard options
     properly.  You need not define `WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG' unless you
     wish to add additional options which take arguments.  Any
     redefinition should call `DEFAULT_WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG' and then
     check for additional options.

`SWITCHES_NEED_SPACES'
     A string-valued C expression which is nonempty if the linker needs
     a space between the `-L' or `-o' option and its argument.

     If this macro is not defined, the default value is 0.

`CPP_SPEC'
     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
     pass to CPP.  It can also specify how to translate options you
     give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the CPP.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

`NO_BUILTIN_SIZE_TYPE'
     If this macro is defined, the preprocessor will not define the
     builtin macro `__SIZE_TYPE__'.  The macro `__SIZE_TYPE__' must
     then be defined by `CPP_SPEC' instead.

     This should be defined if `SIZE_TYPE' depends on target dependent
     flags which are not accessible to the preprocessor.  Otherwise, it
     should not be defined.

`NO_BUILTIN_PTRDIFF_TYPE'
     If this macro is defined, the preprocessor will not define the
     builtin macro `__PTRDIFF_TYPE__'.  The macro `__PTRDIFF_TYPE__'
     must then be defined by `CPP_SPEC' instead.

     This should be defined if `PTRDIFF_TYPE' depends on target
     dependent flags which are not accessible to the preprocessor.
     Otherwise, it should not be defined.

`SIGNED_CHAR_SPEC'
     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
     pass to CPP.  By default, this macro is defined to pass the option
     `-D__CHAR_UNSIGNED__' to CPP if `char' will be treated as
     `unsigned char' by `cc1'.

     Do not define this macro unless you need to override the default
     definition.

`CC1_SPEC'
     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
     pass to `cc1'.  It can also specify how to translate options you
     give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the `cc1'.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

`CC1PLUS_SPEC'
     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
     pass to `cc1plus'.  It can also specify how to translate options
     you give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the
     `cc1plus'.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

`ASM_SPEC'
     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
     pass to the assembler.  It can also specify how to translate
     options you give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the
     assembler.  See the file `sun3.h' for an example of this.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

`ASM_FINAL_SPEC'
     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program how to
     run any programs which cleanup after the normal assembler.
     Normally, this is not needed.  See the file `mips.h' for an
     example of this.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

`LINK_SPEC'
     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
     pass to the linker.  It can also specify how to translate options
     you give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the linker.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

`LIB_SPEC'
     Another C string constant used much like `LINK_SPEC'.  The
     difference between the two is that `LIB_SPEC' is used at the end
     of the command given to the linker.

     If this macro is not defined, a default is provided that loads the
     standard C library from the usual place.  See `gcc.c'.

`STARTFILE_SPEC'
     Another C string constant used much like `LINK_SPEC'.  The
     difference between the two is that `STARTFILE_SPEC' is used at the
     very beginning of the command given to the linker.

     If this macro is not defined, a default is provided that loads the
     standard C startup file from the usual place.  See `gcc.c'.

`ENDFILE_SPEC'
     Another C string constant used much like `LINK_SPEC'.  The
     difference between the two is that `ENDFILE_SPEC' is used at the
     very end of the command given to the linker.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

`LINK_LIBGCC_SPECIAL'
     Define this macro meaning that `gcc' should find the library
     `libgcc.a' by hand, rather than passing the argument `-lgcc' to
     tell the linker to do the search; also, `gcc' should not generate
     `-L' options to pass to the linker (as it normally does).

`LINK_LIBGCC_SPECIAL_1'
     Define this macro meaning that `gcc' should find the library
     `libgcc.a' by hand, rather than passing the argument `-lgcc' to
     tell the linker to do the search.

`RELATIVE_PREFIX_NOT_LINKDIR'
     Define this macro to tell `gcc' that it should only translate a
     `-B' prefix into a `-L' linker option if the prefix indicates an
     absolute file name.

`STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX'
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
     the standard choice of `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/' as the default
     prefix to try when searching for the executable files of the
     compiler.

`MD_EXEC_PREFIX'
     If defined, this macro is an additional prefix to try after
     `STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX'.  `MD_EXEC_PREFIX' is not searched when the
     `-b' option is used, or the compiler is built as a cross compiler.

`STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX'
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
     the standard choice of `/usr/local/lib/' as the default prefix to
     try when searching for startup files such as `crt0.o'.

`MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX'
     If defined, this macro supplies an additional prefix to try after
     the standard prefixes.  `MD_EXEC_PREFIX' is not searched when the
     `-b' option is used, or when the compiler is built as a cross
     compiler.

`MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX_1'
     If defined, this macro supplies yet another prefix to try after the
     standard prefixes.  It is not searched when the `-b' option is
     used, or when the compiler is built as a cross compiler.

`LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR'
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
     the standard choice of `/usr/local/include' as the default prefix
     to try when searching for local header files.  `LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR'
     comes before `SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR' in the search order.

     Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search either
     `/usr/local/include' or its replacement.

`SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR'
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to specify a
     system-specific directory to search for header files before the
     standard directory.  `SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR' comes before
     `STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR' in the search order.

     Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search the
     directory specified.

`STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR'
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
     the standard choice of `/usr/include' as the default prefix to try
     when searching for header files.

     Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search either
     `/usr/include' or its replacement.

`INCLUDE_DEFAULTS'
     Define this macro if you wish to override the entire default
     search path for include files.  The default search path includes
     `GCC_INCLUDE_DIR', `LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR', `SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR',
     `GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR', and `STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR'.  In addition,
     `GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR' and `GCC_INCLUDE_DIR' are defined
     automatically by `Makefile', and specify private search areas for
     GCC.  The directory `GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR' is used only for C++
     programs.

     The definition should be an initializer for an array of structures.
     Each array element should have two elements: the directory name (a
     string constant) and a flag for C++-only directories.  Mark the
     end of the array with a null element.  For example, here is the
     definition used for VMS:

          #define INCLUDE_DEFAULTS \
          {                                       \
            { "GNU_GXX_INCLUDE:", 1},             \
            { "GNU_CC_INCLUDE:", 0},              \
            { "SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSLIB.]", 0},        \
            { ".", 0},                            \
            { 0, 0}                               \
          }

   Here is the order of prefixes tried for exec files:

  1. Any prefixes specified by the user with `-B'.

  2. The environment variable `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX', if any.

  3. The directories specified by the environment variable
     `COMPILER_PATH'.

  4. The macro `STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX'.

  5. `/usr/lib/gcc/'.

  6. The macro `MD_EXEC_PREFIX', if any.

   Here is the order of prefixes tried for startfiles:

  1. Any prefixes specified by the user with `-B'.

  2. The environment variable `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX', if any.

  3. The directories specified by the environment variable
     `LIBRARY_PATH'.

  4. The macro `STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX'.

  5. `/usr/lib/gcc/'.

  6. The macro `MD_EXEC_PREFIX', if any.

  7. The macro `MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX', if any.

  8. The macro `STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX'.

  9. `/lib/'.

 10. `/usr/lib/'.




Run-time Target Specification
=============================

   Here are run-time target specifications.

`CPP_PREDEFINES'
     Define this to be a string constant containing `-D' options to
     define the predefined macros that identify this machine and system.
     These macros will be predefined unless the `-ansi' option is
     specified.

     In addition, a parallel set of macros are predefined, whose names
     are made by appending `__' at the beginning and at the end.  These
     `__' macros are permitted by the ANSI standard, so they are
     predefined regardless of whether `-ansi' is specified.

     For example, on the Sun, one can use the following value:

          "-Dmc68000 -Dsun -Dunix"

     The result is to define the macros `__mc68000__', `__sun__' and
     `__unix__' unconditionally, and the macros `mc68000', `sun' and
     `unix' provided `-ansi' is not specified.

`STDC_VALUE'
     Define the value to be assigned to the built-in macro `__STDC__'.
     The default is the value `1'.

`extern int target_flags;'
     This declaration should be present.

`TARGET_...'
     This series of macros is to allow compiler command arguments to
     enable or disable the use of optional features of the target
     machine.  For example, one machine description serves both the
     68000 and the 68020; a command argument tells the compiler whether
     it should use 68020-only instructions or not.  This command
     argument works by means of a macro `TARGET_68020' that tests a bit
     in `target_flags'.

     Define a macro `TARGET_FEATURENAME' for each such option.  Its
     definition should test a bit in `target_flags'; for example:

          #define TARGET_68020 (target_flags & 1)

     One place where these macros are used is in the
     condition-expressions of instruction patterns.  Note how
     `TARGET_68020' appears frequently in the 68000 machine description
     file, `m68k.md'.  Another place they are used is in the
     definitions of the other macros in the `MACHINE.h' file.

`TARGET_SWITCHES'
     This macro defines names of command options to set and clear bits
     in `target_flags'.  Its definition is an initializer with a
     subgrouping for each command option.

     Each subgrouping contains a string constant, that defines the
     option name, and a number, which contains the bits to set in
     `target_flags'.  A negative number says to clear bits instead; the
     negative of the number is which bits to clear.  The actual option
     name is made by appending `-m' to the specified name.

     One of the subgroupings should have a null string.  The number in
     this grouping is the default value for `target_flags'.  Any target
     options act starting with that value.

     Here is an example which defines `-m68000' and `-m68020' with
     opposite meanings, and picks the latter as the default:

          #define TARGET_SWITCHES \
            { { "68020", 1},      \
              { "68000", -1},     \
              { "", 1}}

`TARGET_OPTIONS'
     This macro is similar to `TARGET_SWITCHES' but defines names of
     command options that have values.  Its definition is an
     initializer with a subgrouping for each command option.

     Each subgrouping contains a string constant, that defines the
     fixed part of the option name, and the address of a variable.  The
     variable, type `char *', is set to the variable part of the given
     option if the fixed part matches.  The actual option name is made
     by appending `-m' to the specified name.

     Here is an example which defines `-mshort-data-NUMBER'.  If the
     given option is `-mshort-data-512', the variable `m88k_short_data'
     will be set to the string `"512"'.

          extern char *m88k_short_data;
          #define TARGET_OPTIONS \
           { { "short-data-", &m88k_short_data } }

`TARGET_VERSION'
     This macro is a C statement to print on `stderr' a string
     describing the particular machine description choice.  Every
     machine description should define `TARGET_VERSION'.  For example:

          #ifdef MOTOROLA
          #define TARGET_VERSION \
            fprintf (stderr, " (68k, Motorola syntax)");
          #else
          #define TARGET_VERSION \
            fprintf (stderr, " (68k, MIT syntax)");
          #endif

`OVERRIDE_OPTIONS'
     Sometimes certain combinations of command options do not make
     sense on a particular target machine.  You can define a macro
     `OVERRIDE_OPTIONS' to take account of this.  This macro, if
     defined, is executed once just after all the command options have
     been parsed.

     Don't use this macro to turn on various extra optimizations for
     `-O'.  That is what `OPTIMIZATION_OPTIONS' is for.

`OPTIMIZATION_OPTIONS (LEVEL)'
     Some machines may desire to change what optimizations are
     performed for various optimization levels.   This macro, if
     defined, is executed once just after the optimization level is
     determined and before the remainder of the command options have
     been parsed.  Values set in this macro are used as the default
     values for the other command line options.

     LEVEL is the optimization level specified; 2 if `-O2' is
     specified, 1 if `-O' is specified, and 0 if neither is specified.

     You should not use this macro to change options that are not
     machine-specific.  These should uniformly selected by the same
     optimization level on all supported machines.  Use this macro to
     enable machbine-specific optimizations.

     *Do not examine `write_symbols' in this macro!* The debugging
     options are not supposed to alter the generated code.

`CAN_DEBUG_WITHOUT_FP'
     Define this macro if debugging can be performed even without a
     frame pointer.  If this macro is defined, GNU CC will turn on the
     `-fomit-frame-pointer' option whenever `-O' is specified.




Storage Layout
==============

   Note that the definitions of the macros in this table which are
sizes or alignments measured in bits do not need to be constant.  They
can be C expressions that refer to static variables, such as the
`target_flags'.  *Note Run-time Target::.

`BITS_BIG_ENDIAN'
     Define this macro to be the value 1 if the most significant bit in
     a byte has the lowest number; otherwise define it to be the value
     zero.  This means that bit-field instructions count from the most
     significant bit.  If the machine has no bit-field instructions,
     then this must still be defined, but it doesn't matter which value
     it is defined to.

     This macro does not affect the way structure fields are packed into
     bytes or words; that is controlled by `BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN'.

`BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN'
     Define this macro to be 1 if the most significant byte in a word
     has the lowest number.

`WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'
     Define this macro to be 1 if, in a multiword object, the most
     significant word has the lowest number.  This applies to both
     memory locations and registers; GNU CC fundamentally assumes that
     the order of words in memory is the same as the order in registers.

`FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'
     Define this macro to be 1 if `DFmode', `XFmode' or `TFmode'
     floating point numbers are stored in memory with the word
     containing the sign bit at the lowest address; otherwise define it
     to be 0.

     You need not define this macro if the ordering is the same as for
     multi-word integers.

`BITS_PER_UNIT'
     Define this macro to be the number of bits in an addressable
     storage unit (byte); normally 8.

`BITS_PER_WORD'
     Number of bits in a word; normally 32.

`MAX_BITS_PER_WORD'
     Maximum number of bits in a word.  If this is undefined, the
     default is `BITS_PER_WORD'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value
     that is the largest value that `BITS_PER_WORD' can have at
     run-time.

`UNITS_PER_WORD'
     Number of storage units in a word; normally 4.

`MAX_UNITS_PER_WORD'
     Maximum number of units in a word.  If this is undefined, the
     default is `UNITS_PER_WORD'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value
     that is the largest value that `UNITS_PER_WORD' can have at
     run-time.

`POINTER_SIZE'
     Width of a pointer, in bits.

`PROMOTE_MODE (M, UNSIGNEDP, TYPE)'
     A macro to update M and UNSIGNEDP when an object whose type is
     TYPE and which has the specified mode and signedness is to be
     stored in a register.  This macro is only called when TYPE is a
     scalar type.

     On most RISC machines, which only have operations that operate on
     a full register, define this macro to set M to `word_mode' if M is
     an integer mode narrower than `BITS_PER_WORD'.  In most cases,
     only integer modes should be widened because wider-precision
     floating-point operations are usually more expensive than their
     narrower counterparts.

     For most machines, the macro definition does not change UNSIGNEDP.
     However, some machines, have instructions that preferentially
     handle either signed or unsigned quantities of certain modes.  For
     example, on the DEC Alpha, 32-bit loads from memory and 32-bit add
     instructions sign-extend the result to 64 bits.  On such machines,
     set UNSIGNEDP according to which kind of extension is more
     efficient.

     Do not define this macro if it would never modify M.

`PROMOTE_FUNCTION_ARGS'
     Define this macro if the promotion described by `PROMOTE_MODE'
     should also be done for outgoing function arguments.

`PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN'
     Define this macro if the promotion described by `PROMOTE_MODE'
     should also be done for the return value of functions.

     If this macro is defined, `FUNCTION_VALUE' must perform the same
     promotions done by `PROMOTE_MODE'.

`PROMOTE_FOR_CALL_ONLY'
     Define this macro if the promotion described by `PROMOTE_MODE'
     should *only* be performed for outgoing function arguments or
     function return values, as specified by `PROMOTE_FUNCTION_ARGS'
     and `PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN', respectively.

`PARM_BOUNDARY'
     Normal alignment required for function parameters on the stack, in
     bits.  All stack parameters receive at least this much alignment
     regardless of data type.  On most machines, this is the same as the
     size of an integer.

`STACK_BOUNDARY'
     Define this macro if you wish to preserve a certain alignment for
     the stack pointer.  The definition is a C expression for the
     desired alignment (measured in bits).

     If `PUSH_ROUNDING' is not defined, the stack will always be aligned
     to the specified boundary.  If `PUSH_ROUNDING' is defined and
     specifies a less strict alignment than `STACK_BOUNDARY', the stack
     may be momentarily unaligned while pushing arguments.

`FUNCTION_BOUNDARY'
     Alignment required for a function entry point, in bits.

`BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'
     Biggest alignment that any data type can require on this machine,
     in bits.

`BIGGEST_FIELD_ALIGNMENT'
     Biggest alignment that any structure field can require on this
     machine, in bits.  If defined, this overrides `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'
     for structure fields only.

`MAX_OFILE_ALIGNMENT'
     Biggest alignment supported by the object file format of this
     machine.  Use this macro to limit the alignment which can be
     specified using the `__attribute__ ((aligned (N)))' construct.  If
     not defined, the default value is `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'.

`DATA_ALIGNMENT (TYPE, BASIC-ALIGN)'
     If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment for a static
     variable.  TYPE is the data type, and BASIC-ALIGN is the alignment
     that the object would ordinarily have.  The value of this macro is
     used instead of that alignment to align the object.

     If this macro is not defined, then BASIC-ALIGN is used.

     One use of this macro is to increase alignment of medium-size data
     to make it all fit in fewer cache lines.  Another is to cause
     character arrays to be word-aligned so that `strcpy' calls that
     copy constants to character arrays can be done inline.

`CONSTANT_ALIGNMENT (CONSTANT, BASIC-ALIGN)'
     If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment given to a
     constant that is being placed in memory.  CONSTANT is the constant
     and BASIC-ALIGN is the alignment that the object would ordinarily
     have.  The value of this macro is used instead of that alignment to
     align the object.

     If this macro is not defined, then BASIC-ALIGN is used.

     The typical use of this macro is to increase alignment for string
     constants to be word aligned so that `strcpy' calls that copy
     constants can be done inline.

`EMPTY_FIELD_BOUNDARY'
     Alignment in bits to be given to a structure bit field that
     follows an empty field such as `int : 0;'.

     Note that `PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS' also affects the alignment
     that results from an empty field.

`STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY'
     Number of bits which any structure or union's size must be a
     multiple of.  Each structure or union's size is rounded up to a
     multiple of this.

     If you do not define this macro, the default is the same as
     `BITS_PER_UNIT'.

`STRICT_ALIGNMENT'
     Define this macro to be the value 1 if instructions will fail to
     work if given data not on the nominal alignment.  If instructions
     will merely go slower in that case, define this macro as 0.

`PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS'
     Define this if you wish to imitate the way many other C compilers
     handle alignment of bitfields and the structures that contain them.

     The behavior is that the type written for a bitfield (`int',
     `short', or other integer type) imposes an alignment for the
     entire structure, as if the structure really did contain an
     ordinary field of that type.  In addition, the bitfield is placed
     within the structure so that it would fit within such a field, not
     crossing a boundary for it.

     Thus, on most machines, a bitfield whose type is written as `int'
     would not cross a four-byte boundary, and would force four-byte
     alignment for the whole structure.  (The alignment used may not be
     four bytes; it is controlled by the other alignment parameters.)

     If the macro is defined, its definition should be a C expression;
     a nonzero value for the expression enables this behavior.

     Note that if this macro is not defined, or its value is zero, some
     bitfields may cross more than one alignment boundary.  The
     compiler can support such references if there are `insv', `extv',
     and `extzv' insns that can directly reference memory.

     The other known way of making bitfields work is to define
     `STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY' as large as `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'.  Then
     every structure can be accessed with fullwords.

     Unless the machine has bitfield instructions or you define
     `STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY' that way, you must define
     `PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS' to have a nonzero value.

     If your aim is to make GNU CC use the same conventions for laying
     out bitfields as are used by another compiler, here is how to
     investigate what the other compiler does.  Compile and run this
     program:

          struct foo1
          {
            char x;
            char :0;
            char y;
          };

          struct foo2
          {
            char x;
            int :0;
            char y;
          };

          main ()
          {
            printf ("Size of foo1 is %d\n",
                    sizeof (struct foo1));
            printf ("Size of foo2 is %d\n",
                    sizeof (struct foo2));
            exit (0);
          }

     If this prints 2 and 5, then the compiler's behavior is what you
     would get from `PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS'.

`BITFIELD_NBYTES_LIMITED'
     Like PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS except that its effect is limited to
     aligning a bitfield within the structure.

`ROUND_TYPE_SIZE (STRUCT, SIZE, ALIGN)'
     Define this macro as an expression for the overall size of a
     structure (given by STRUCT as a tree node) when the size computed
     from the fields is SIZE and the alignment is ALIGN.

     The default is to round SIZE up to a multiple of ALIGN.

`ROUND_TYPE_ALIGN (STRUCT, COMPUTED, SPECIFIED)'
     Define this macro as an expression for the alignment of a structure
     (given by STRUCT as a tree node) if the alignment computed in the
     usual way is COMPUTED and the alignment explicitly specified was
     SPECIFIED.

     The default is to use SPECIFIED if it is larger; otherwise, use
     the smaller of COMPUTED and `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'

`MAX_FIXED_MODE_SIZE'
     An integer expression for the size in bits of the largest integer
     machine mode that should actually be used.  All integer machine
     modes of this size or smaller can be used for structures and
     unions with the appropriate sizes.  If this macro is undefined,
     `GET_MODE_BITSIZE (DImode)' is assumed.

`CHECK_FLOAT_VALUE (MODE, VALUE, OVERFLOW)'
     A C statement to validate the value VALUE (of type `double') for
     mode MODE.  This means that you check whether VALUE fits within
     the possible range of values for mode MODE on this target machine.
     The mode MODE is always a mode of class `MODE_FLOAT'.  OVERFLOW
     is nonzero if the value is already known to be out of range.

     If VALUE is not valid or if OVERFLOW is nonzero, you should set
     OVERFLOW to 1 and then assign some valid value to VALUE.  Allowing
     an invalid value to go through the compiler can produce incorrect
     assembler code which may even cause Unix assemblers to crash.

     This macro need not be defined if there is no work for it to do.

`TARGET_FLOAT_FORMAT'
     A code distinguishing the floating point format of the target
     machine.  There are three defined values:

    `IEEE_FLOAT_FORMAT'
          This code indicates IEEE floating point.  It is the default;
          there is no need to define this macro when the format is IEEE.

    `VAX_FLOAT_FORMAT'
          This code indicates the peculiar format used on the Vax.

    `UNKNOWN_FLOAT_FORMAT'
          This code indicates any other format.

     The value of this macro is compared with `HOST_FLOAT_FORMAT'
     (*note Config::.) to determine whether the target machine has the
     same format as the host machine.  If any other formats are
     actually in use on supported machines, new codes should be defined
     for them.

     The ordering of the component words of floating point values
     stored in memory is controlled by `FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN' for the
     target machine and `HOST_FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN' for the host.




Layout of Source Language Data Types
====================================

   These macros define the sizes and other characteristics of the
standard basic data types used in programs being compiled.  Unlike the
macros in the previous section, these apply to specific features of C
and related languages, rather than to fundamental aspects of storage
layout.

`INT_TYPE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `int' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

`MAX_INT_TYPE_SIZE'
     Maximum number for the size in bits of the type `int' on the target
     machine.  If this is undefined, the default is `INT_TYPE_SIZE'.
     Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the largest value that
     `INT_TYPE_SIZE' can have at run-time.  This is used in `cpp'.

`SHORT_TYPE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `short' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is half a
     word.  (If this would be less than one storage unit, it is rounded
     up to one unit.)

`LONG_TYPE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `long' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

`MAX_LONG_TYPE_SIZE'
     Maximum number for the size in bits of the type `long' on the
     target machine.  If this is undefined, the default is
     `LONG_TYPE_SIZE'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
     largest value that `LONG_TYPE_SIZE' can have at run-time.  This is
     used in `cpp'.

`LONG_LONG_TYPE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `long long' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
     words.

`CHAR_TYPE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `char' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one
     quarter of a word.  (If this would be less than one storage unit,
     it is rounded up to one unit.)

`MAX_CHAR_TYPE_SIZE'
     Maximum number for the size in bits of the type `char' on the
     target machine.  If this is undefined, the default is
     `CHAR_TYPE_SIZE'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
     largest value that `CHAR_TYPE_SIZE' can have at run-time.  This is
     used in `cpp'.

`FLOAT_TYPE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `float' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

`DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `double' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
     words.

`LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `long double' on
     the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
     words.

`DEFAULT_SIGNED_CHAR'
     An expression whose value is 1 or 0, according to whether the type
     `char' should be signed or unsigned by default.  The user can
     always override this default with the options `-fsigned-char' and
     `-funsigned-char'.

`DEFAULT_SHORT_ENUMS'
     A C expression to determine whether to give an `enum' type only as
     many bytes as it takes to represent the range of possible values
     of that type.  A nonzero value means to do that; a zero value
     means all `enum' types should be allocated like `int'.

     If you don't define the macro, the default is 0.

`SIZE_TYPE'
     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type
     to use for size values.  The typedef name `size_t' is defined
     using the contents of the string.

     The string can contain more than one keyword.  If so, separate
     them with spaces, and write first any length keyword, then
     `unsigned' if appropriate, and finally `int'.  The string must
     exactly match one of the data type names defined in the function
     `init_decl_processing' in the file `c-decl.c'.  You may not omit
     `int' or change the order--that would cause the compiler to crash
     on startup.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is `"long unsigned
     int"'.

`PTRDIFF_TYPE'
     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type
     to use for the result of subtracting two pointers.  The typedef
     name `ptrdiff_t' is defined using the contents of the string.  See
     `SIZE_TYPE' above for more information.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is `"long int"'.

`WCHAR_TYPE'
     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type
     to use for wide characters.  The typedef name `wchar_t' is defined
     using the contents of the string.  See `SIZE_TYPE' above for more
     information.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is `"int"'.

`WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the data type for wide
     characters.  This is used in `cpp', which cannot make use of
     `WCHAR_TYPE'.

`MAX_WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE'
     Maximum number for the size in bits of the data type for wide
     characters.  If this is undefined, the default is
     `WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
     largest value that `WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE' can have at run-time.  This is
     used in `cpp'.

`OBJC_INT_SELECTORS'
     Define this macro if the type of Objective C selectors should be
     `int'.

     If this macro is not defined, then selectors should have the type
     `struct objc_selector *'.

`OBJC_SELECTORS_WITHOUT_LABELS'
     Define this macro if the compiler can group all the selectors
     together into a vector and use just one label at the beginning of
     the vector.  Otherwise, the compiler must give each selector its
     own assembler label.

     On certain machines, it is important to have a separate label for
     each selector because this enables the linker to eliminate
     duplicate selectors.

`TARGET_BELL'
     A C constant expression for the integer value for escape sequence
     `\a'.

`TARGET_BS'
`TARGET_TAB'
`TARGET_NEWLINE'
     C constant expressions for the integer values for escape sequences
     `\b', `\t' and `\n'.

`TARGET_VT'
`TARGET_FF'
`TARGET_CR'
     C constant expressions for the integer values for escape sequences
     `\v', `\f' and `\r'.




Register Usage
==============

   This section explains how to describe what registers the target
machine has, and how (in general) they can be used.

   The description of which registers a specific instruction can use is
done with register classes; see *Note Register Classes::.  For
information on using registers to access a stack frame, see *Note Frame
Registers::.  For passing values in registers, see *Note Register
Arguments::.  For returning values in registers, see *Note Scalar
Return::.


Basic Characteristics of Registers
----------------------------------

   Registers have various characteristics.

`FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER'
     Number of hardware registers known to the compiler.  They receive
     numbers 0 through `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER-1'; thus, the first
     pseudo register's number really is assigned the number
     `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER'.

`FIXED_REGISTERS'
     An initializer that says which registers are used for fixed
     purposes all throughout the compiled code and are therefore not
     available for general allocation.  These would include the stack
     pointer, the frame pointer (except on machines where that can be
     used as a general register when no frame pointer is needed), the
     program counter on machines where that is considered one of the
     addressable registers, and any other numbered register with a
     standard use.

     This information is expressed as a sequence of numbers, separated
     by commas and surrounded by braces.  The Nth number is 1 if
     register N is fixed, 0 otherwise.

     The table initialized from this macro, and the table initialized by
     the following one, may be overridden at run time either
     automatically, by the actions of the macro
     `CONDITIONAL_REGISTER_USAGE', or by the user with the command
     options `-ffixed-REG', `-fcall-used-REG' and `-fcall-saved-REG'.

`CALL_USED_REGISTERS'
     Like `FIXED_REGISTERS' but has 1 for each register that is
     clobbered (in general) by function calls as well as for fixed
     registers.  This macro therefore identifies the registers that are
     not available for general allocation of values that must live
     across function calls.

     If a register has 0 in `CALL_USED_REGISTERS', the compiler
     automatically saves it on function entry and restores it on
     function exit, if the register is used within the function.

`CONDITIONAL_REGISTER_USAGE'
     Zero or more C statements that may conditionally modify two
     variables `fixed_regs' and `call_used_regs' (both of type `char
     []') after they have been initialized from the two preceding
     macros.

     This is necessary in case the fixed or call-clobbered registers
     depend on target flags.

     You need not define this macro if it has no work to do.

     If the usage of an entire class of registers depends on the target
     flags, you may indicate this to GCC by using this macro to modify
     `fixed_regs' and `call_used_regs' to 1 for each of the registers
     in the classes which should not be used by GCC.  Also define the
     macro `REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER' to return `NO_REGS' if it is called
     with a letter for a class that shouldn't be used.

     (However, if this class is not included in `GENERAL_REGS' and all
     of the insn patterns whose constraints permit this class are
     controlled by target switches, then GCC will automatically avoid
     using these registers when the target switches are opposed to
     them.)

`NON_SAVING_SETJMP'
     If this macro is defined and has a nonzero value, it means that
     `setjmp' and related functions fail to save the registers, or that
     `longjmp' fails to restore them.  To compensate, the compiler
     avoids putting variables in registers in functions that use
     `setjmp'.

`INCOMING_REGNO (OUT)'
     Define this macro if the target machine has register windows.
     This C expression returns the register number as seen by the
     called function corresponding to the register number OUT as seen
     by the calling function.  Return OUT if register number OUT is not
     an outbound register.

`OUTGOING_REGNO (IN)'
     Define this macro if the target machine has register windows.
     This C expression returns the register number as seen by the
     calling function corresponding to the register number IN as seen
     by the called function.  Return IN if register number IN is not an
     inbound register.




Order of Allocation of Registers
--------------------------------

   Registers are allocated in order.

`REG_ALLOC_ORDER'
     If defined, an initializer for a vector of integers, containing the
     numbers of hard registers in the order in which GNU CC should
     prefer to use them (from most preferred to least).

     If this macro is not defined, registers are used lowest numbered
     first (all else being equal).

     One use of this macro is on machines where the highest numbered
     registers must always be saved and the save-multiple-registers
     instruction supports only sequences of consecutive registers.  On
     such machines, define `REG_ALLOC_ORDER' to be an initializer that
     lists the highest numbered allocatable register first.

`ORDER_REGS_FOR_LOCAL_ALLOC'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to choose the order in which to
     allocate hard registers for pseudo-registers local to a basic
     block.

     Store the desired register order in the array `reg_alloc_order'.
     Element 0 should be the register to allocate first; element 1, the
     next register; and so on.

     The macro body should not assume anything about the contents of
     `reg_alloc_order' before execution of the macro.

     On most machines, it is not necessary to define this macro.




How Values Fit in Registers
---------------------------

   This section discusses the macros that describe which kinds of values
(specifically, which machine modes) each register can hold, and how many
consecutive registers are needed for a given mode.

`HARD_REGNO_NREGS (REGNO, MODE)'
     A C expression for the number of consecutive hard registers,
     starting at register number REGNO, required to hold a value of mode
     MODE.

     On a machine where all registers are exactly one word, a suitable
     definition of this macro is

          #define HARD_REGNO_NREGS(REGNO, MODE)            \
             ((GET_MODE_SIZE (MODE) + UNITS_PER_WORD - 1)  \
              / UNITS_PER_WORD))

`HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (REGNO, MODE)'
     A C expression that is nonzero if it is permissible to store a
     value of mode MODE in hard register number REGNO (or in several
     registers starting with that one).  For a machine where all
     registers are equivalent, a suitable definition is

          #define HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK(REGNO, MODE) 1

     It is not necessary for this macro to check for the numbers of
     fixed registers, because the allocation mechanism considers them
     to be always occupied.

     On some machines, double-precision values must be kept in even/odd
     register pairs.  The way to implement that is to define this macro
     to reject odd register numbers for such modes.

     The minimum requirement for a mode to be OK in a register is that
     the `movMODE' instruction pattern support moves between the
     register and any other hard register for which the mode is OK; and
     that moving a value into the register and back out not alter it.

     Since the same instruction used to move `SImode' will work for all
     narrower integer modes, it is not necessary on any machine for
     `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' to distinguish between these modes, provided
     you define patterns `movhi', etc., to take advantage of this.  This
     is useful because of the interaction between `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'
     and `MODES_TIEABLE_P'; it is very desirable for all integer modes
     to be tieable.

     Many machines have special registers for floating point arithmetic.
     Often people assume that floating point machine modes are allowed
     only in floating point registers.  This is not true.  Any
     registers that can hold integers can safely *hold* a floating
     point machine mode, whether or not floating arithmetic can be done
     on it in those registers.  Integer move instructions can be used
     to move the values.

     On some machines, though, the converse is true: fixed-point machine
     modes may not go in floating registers.  This is true if the
     floating registers normalize any value stored in them, because
     storing a non-floating value there would garble it.  In this case,
     `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' should reject fixed-point machine modes in
     floating registers.  But if the floating registers do not
     automatically normalize, if you can store any bit pattern in one
     and retrieve it unchanged without a trap, then any machine mode
     may go in a floating register, so you can define this macro to say
     so.

     The primary significance of special floating registers is rather
     that they are the registers acceptable in floating point arithmetic
     instructions.  However, this is of no concern to
     `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'.  You handle it by writing the proper
     constraints for those instructions.

     On some machines, the floating registers are especially slow to
     access, so that it is better to store a value in a stack frame
     than in such a register if floating point arithmetic is not being
     done.  As long as the floating registers are not in class
     `GENERAL_REGS', they will not be used unless some pattern's
     constraint asks for one.

`MODES_TIEABLE_P (MODE1, MODE2)'
     A C expression that is nonzero if it is desirable to choose
     register allocation so as to avoid move instructions between a
     value of mode MODE1 and a value of mode MODE2.

     If `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (R, MODE1)' and `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (R,
     MODE2)' are ever different for any R, then `MODES_TIEABLE_P (MODE1,
     MODE2)' must be zero.




Handling Leaf Functions
-----------------------

   On some machines, a leaf function (i.e., one which makes no calls)
can run more efficiently if it does not make its own register window.
Often this means it is required to receive its arguments in the
registers where they are passed by the caller, instead of the registers
where they would normally arrive.

   The special treatment for leaf functions generally applies only when
other conditions are met; for example, often they may use only those
registers for its own variables and temporaries.  We use the term "leaf
function" to mean a function that is suitable for this special
handling, so that functions with no calls are not necessarily "leaf
functions".

   GNU CC assigns register numbers before it knows whether the function
is suitable for leaf function treatment.  So it needs to renumber the
registers in order to output a leaf function.  The following macros
accomplish this.

`LEAF_REGISTERS'
     A C initializer for a vector, indexed by hard register number,
     which contains 1 for a register that is allowable in a candidate
     for leaf function treatment.

     If leaf function treatment involves renumbering the registers,
     then the registers marked here should be the ones before
     renumbering--those that GNU CC would ordinarily allocate.  The
     registers which will actually be used in the assembler code, after
     renumbering, should not be marked with 1 in this vector.

     Define this macro only if the target machine offers a way to
     optimize the treatment of leaf functions.

`LEAF_REG_REMAP (REGNO)'
     A C expression whose value is the register number to which REGNO
     should be renumbered, when a function is treated as a leaf
     function.

     If REGNO is a register number which should not appear in a leaf
     function before renumbering, then the expression should yield -1,
     which will cause the compiler to abort.

     Define this macro only if the target machine offers a way to
     optimize the treatment of leaf functions, and registers need to be
     renumbered to do this.

   Normally, `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must treat
leaf functions specially.  It can test the C variable `leaf_function'
which is nonzero for leaf functions.  (The variable `leaf_function' is
defined only if `LEAF_REGISTERS' is defined.)




Registers That Form a Stack
---------------------------

   There are special features to handle computers where some of the
"registers" form a stack, as in the 80387 coprocessor for the 80386.
Stack registers are normally written by pushing onto the stack, and are
numbered relative to the top of the stack.

   Currently, GNU CC can only handle one group of stack-like registers,
and they must be consecutively numbered.

`STACK_REGS'
     Define this if the machine has any stack-like registers.

`FIRST_STACK_REG'
     The number of the first stack-like register.  This one is the top
     of the stack.

`LAST_STACK_REG'
     The number of the last stack-like register.  This one is the
     bottom of the stack.




Obsolete Macros for Controlling Register Usage
----------------------------------------------

   These features do not work very well.  They exist because they used
to be required to generate correct code for the 80387 coprocessor of the
80386.  They are no longer used by that machine description and may be
removed in a later version of the compiler.  Don't use them!

`OVERLAPPING_REGNO_P (REGNO)'
     If defined, this is a C expression whose value is nonzero if hard
     register number REGNO is an overlapping register.  This means a
     hard register which overlaps a hard register with a different
     number.  (Such overlap is undesirable, but occasionally it allows
     a machine to be supported which otherwise could not be.)  This
     macro must return nonzero for *all* the registers which overlap
     each other.  GNU CC can use an overlapping register only in
     certain limited ways.  It can be used for allocation within a
     basic block, and may be spilled for reloading; that is all.

     If this macro is not defined, it means that none of the hard
     registers overlap each other.  This is the usual situation.

`INSN_CLOBBERS_REGNO_P (INSN, REGNO)'
     If defined, this is a C expression whose value should be nonzero if
     the insn INSN has the effect of mysteriously clobbering the
     contents of hard register number REGNO.  By "mysterious" we mean
     that the insn's RTL expression doesn't describe such an effect.

     If this macro is not defined, it means that no insn clobbers
     registers mysteriously.  This is the usual situation; all else
     being equal, it is best for the RTL expression to show all the
     activity.

`PRESERVE_DEATH_INFO_REGNO_P (REGNO)'
     If defined, this is a C expression whose value is nonzero if
     accurate `REG_DEAD' notes are needed for hard register number REGNO
     at the time of outputting the assembler code.  When this is so, a
     few optimizations that take place after register allocation and
     could invalidate the death notes are not done when this register is
     involved.

     You would arrange to preserve death info for a register when some
     of the code in the machine description which is executed to write
     the assembler code looks at the death notes.  This is necessary
     only when the actual hardware feature which GNU CC thinks of as a
     register is not actually a register of the usual sort.  (It might,
     for example, be a hardware stack.)

     If this macro is not defined, it means that no death notes need to
     be preserved.  This is the usual situation.




Register Classes
================

   On many machines, the numbered registers are not all equivalent.
For example, certain registers may not be allowed for indexed
addressing; certain registers may not be allowed in some instructions.
These machine restrictions are described to the compiler using
"register classes".

   You define a number of register classes, giving each one a name and
saying which of the registers belong to it.  Then you can specify
register classes that are allowed as operands to particular instruction
patterns.

   In general, each register will belong to several classes.  In fact,
one class must be named `ALL_REGS' and contain all the registers.
Another class must be named `NO_REGS' and contain no registers.  Often
the union of two classes will be another class; however, this is not
required.

   One of the classes must be named `GENERAL_REGS'.  There is nothing
terribly special about the name, but the operand constraint letters `r'
and `g' specify this class.  If `GENERAL_REGS' is the same as
`ALL_REGS', just define it as a macro which expands to `ALL_REGS'.

   Order the classes so that if class X is contained in class Y then X
has a lower class number than Y.

   The way classes other than `GENERAL_REGS' are specified in operand
constraints is through machine-dependent operand constraint letters.
You can define such letters to correspond to various classes, then use
them in operand constraints.

   You should define a class for the union of two classes whenever some
instruction allows both classes.  For example, if an instruction allows
either a floating point (coprocessor) register or a general register
for a certain operand, you should define a class `FLOAT_OR_GENERAL_REGS'
which includes both of them.  Otherwise you will get suboptimal code.

   You must also specify certain redundant information about the
register classes: for each class, which classes contain it and which
ones are contained in it; for each pair of classes, the largest class
contained in their union.

   When a value occupying several consecutive registers is expected in a
certain class, all the registers used must belong to that class.
Therefore, register classes cannot be used to enforce a requirement for
a register pair to start with an even-numbered register.  The way to
specify this requirement is with `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'.

   Register classes used for input-operands of bitwise-and or shift
instructions have a special requirement: each such class must have, for
each fixed-point machine mode, a subclass whose registers can transfer
that mode to or from memory.  For example, on some machines, the
operations for single-byte values (`QImode') are limited to certain
registers.  When this is so, each register class that is used in a
bitwise-and or shift instruction must have a subclass consisting of
registers from which single-byte values can be loaded or stored.  This
is so that `PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS' can always have a possible value to
return.

`enum reg_class'
     An enumeral type that must be defined with all the register class
     names as enumeral values.  `NO_REGS' must be first.  `ALL_REGS'
     must be the last register class, followed by one more enumeral
     value, `LIM_REG_CLASSES', which is not a register class but rather
     tells how many classes there are.

     Each register class has a number, which is the value of casting
     the class name to type `int'.  The number serves as an index in
     many of the tables described below.

`N_REG_CLASSES'
     The number of distinct register classes, defined as follows:

          #define N_REG_CLASSES (int) LIM_REG_CLASSES

`REG_CLASS_NAMES'
     An initializer containing the names of the register classes as C
     string constants.  These names are used in writing some of the
     debugging dumps.

`REG_CLASS_CONTENTS'
     An initializer containing the contents of the register classes, as
     integers which are bit masks.  The Nth integer specifies the
     contents of class N.  The way the integer MASK is interpreted is
     that register R is in the class if `MASK & (1 << R)' is 1.

     When the machine has more than 32 registers, an integer does not
     suffice.  Then the integers are replaced by sub-initializers,
     braced groupings containing several integers.  Each
     sub-initializer must be suitable as an initializer for the type
     `HARD_REG_SET' which is defined in `hard-reg-set.h'.

`REGNO_REG_CLASS (REGNO)'
     A C expression whose value is a register class containing hard
     register REGNO.  In general there is more than one such class;
     choose a class which is "minimal", meaning that no smaller class
     also contains the register.

`BASE_REG_CLASS'
     A macro whose definition is the name of the class to which a valid
     base register must belong.  A base register is one used in an
     address which is the register value plus a displacement.

`INDEX_REG_CLASS'
     A macro whose definition is the name of the class to which a valid
     index register must belong.  An index register is one used in an
     address where its value is either multiplied by a scale factor or
     added to another register (as well as added to a displacement).

`REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER (CHAR)'
     A C expression which defines the machine-dependent operand
     constraint letters for register classes.  If CHAR is such a
     letter, the value should be the register class corresponding to
     it.  Otherwise, the value should be `NO_REGS'.  The register
     letter `r', corresponding to class `GENERAL_REGS', will not be
     passed to this macro; you do not need to handle it.

`REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P (NUM)'
     A C expression which is nonzero if register number NUM is suitable
     for use as a base register in operand addresses.  It may be either
     a suitable hard register or a pseudo register that has been
     allocated such a hard register.

`REGNO_OK_FOR_INDEX_P (NUM)'
     A C expression which is nonzero if register number NUM is suitable
     for use as an index register in operand addresses.  It may be
     either a suitable hard register or a pseudo register that has been
     allocated such a hard register.

     The difference between an index register and a base register is
     that the index register may be scaled.  If an address involves the
     sum of two registers, neither one of them scaled, then either one
     may be labeled the "base" and the other the "index"; but whichever
     labeling is used must fit the machine's constraints of which
     registers may serve in each capacity.  The compiler will try both
     labelings, looking for one that is valid, and will reload one or
     both registers only if neither labeling works.

`PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS (X, CLASS)'
     A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register
     class to use when it is necessary to copy value X into a register
     in class CLASS.  The value is a register class; perhaps CLASS, or
     perhaps another, smaller class.  On many machines, the following
     definition is safe:

          #define PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS(X,CLASS) CLASS

     Sometimes returning a more restrictive class makes better code.
     For example, on the 68000, when X is an integer constant that is
     in range for a `moveq' instruction, the value of this macro is
     always `DATA_REGS' as long as CLASS includes the data registers.
     Requiring a data register guarantees that a `moveq' will be used.

     If X is a `const_double', by returning `NO_REGS' you can force X
     into a memory constant.  This is useful on certain machines where
     immediate floating values cannot be loaded into certain kinds of
     registers.

`PREFERRED_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (X, CLASS)'
     Like `PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS', but for output reloads instead of
     input reloads.  If you don't define this macro, the default is to
     use CLASS, unchanged.

`LIMIT_RELOAD_CLASS (MODE, CLASS)'
     A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register
     class to use when it is necessary to be able to hold a value of
     mode MODE in a reload register for which class CLASS would
     ordinarily be used.

     Unlike `PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS', this macro should be used when
     there are certain modes that simply can't go in certain reload
     classes.

     The value is a register class; perhaps CLASS, or perhaps another,
     smaller class.

     Don't define this macro unless the target machine has limitations
     which require the macro to do something nontrivial.

`SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS (CLASS, MODE, X)'
`SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (CLASS, MODE, X)'
`SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (CLASS, MODE, X)'
     Many machines have some registers that cannot be copied directly
     to or from memory or even from other types of registers.  An
     example is the `MQ' register, which on most machines, can only be
     copied to or from general registers, but not memory.  Some
     machines allow copying all registers to and from memory, but
     require a scratch register for stores to some memory locations
     (e.g., those with symbolic address on the RT, and those with
     certain symbolic address on the Sparc when compiling PIC).  In
     some cases, both an intermediate and a scratch register are
     required.

     You should define these macros to indicate to the reload phase
     that it may need to allocate at least one register for a reload in
     addition to the register to contain the data.  Specifically, if
     copying X to a register CLASS in MODE requires an intermediate
     register, you should define `SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' to
     return the largest register class all of whose registers can be
     used as intermediate registers or scratch registers.

     If copying a register CLASS in MODE to X requires an intermediate
     or scratch register, `SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' should be
     defined to return the largest register class required.  If the
     requirements for input and output reloads are the same, the macro
     `SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS' should be used instead of defining both
     macros identically.

     The values returned by these macros are often `GENERAL_REGS'.
     Return `NO_REGS' if no spare register is needed; i.e., if X can be
     directly copied to or from a register of CLASS in MODE without
     requiring a scratch register.  Do not define this macro if it
     would always return `NO_REGS'.

     If a scratch register is required (either with or without an
     intermediate register), you should define patterns for
     `reload_inM' or `reload_outM', as required (*note Standard
     Names::..  These patterns, which will normally be implemented with
     a `define_expand', should be similar to the `movM' patterns,
     except that operand 2 is the scratch register.

     Define constraints for the reload register and scratch register
     that contain a single register class.  If the original reload
     register (whose class is CLASS) can meet the constraint given in
     the pattern, the value returned by these macros is used for the
     class of the scratch register.  Otherwise, two additional reload
     registers are required.  Their classes are obtained from the
     constraints in the insn pattern.

     X might be a pseudo-register or a `subreg' of a pseudo-register,
     which could either be in a hard register or in memory.  Use
     `true_regnum' to find out; it will return -1 if the pseudo is in
     memory and the hard register number if it is in a register.

     These macros should not be used in the case where a particular
     class of registers can only be copied to memory and not to another
     class of registers.  In that case, secondary reload registers are
     not needed and would not be helpful.  Instead, a stack location
     must be used to perform the copy and the `movM' pattern should use
     memory as a intermediate storage.  This case often occurs between
     floating-point and general registers.

`SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED (CLASS1, CLASS2, M)'
     Certain machines have the property that some registers cannot be
     copied to some other registers without using memory.  Define this
     macro on those machines to be a C expression that is non-zero if
     objects of mode M in registers of CLASS1 can only be copied to
     registers of class CLASS2 by storing a register of CLASS1 into
     memory and loading that memory location into a register of CLASS2.

     Do not define this macro if its value would always be zero.

`SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED_RTX (MODE)'
     Normally when `SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED' is defined, the compiler
     allocates a stack slot for a memory location needed for register
     copies.  If this macro is defined, the compiler instead uses the
     memory location defined by this macro.

     Do not define this macro if you do not define
     `SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED'.

`SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED_MODE (MODE)'
     When the compiler needs a secondary memory location to copy
     between two registers of mode MODE, it normally allocates
     sufficient memory to hold a quantity of `BITS_PER_WORD' bits and
     performs the store and load operations in a mode that many bits
     wide and whose class is the same as that of MODE.

     This is right thing to do on most machines because it ensures that
     all bits of the register are copied and prevents accesses to the
     registers in a narrower mode, which some machines prohibit for
     floating-point registers.

     However, this default behavior is not correct on some machines,
     such as the DEC Alpha, that store short integers in floating-point
     registers differently than in integer registers.  On those
     machines, the default widening will not work correctly and you
     must define this macro to suppress that widening in some cases.
     See the file `alpha.h' for details.

     Do not define this macro if you do not define
     `SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED' or if widening MODE to a mode that is
     `BITS_PER_WORD' bits wide is correct for your machine.

`SMALL_REGISTER_CLASSES'
     Normally the compiler avoids choosing registers that have been
     explicitly mentioned in the rtl as spill registers (these
     registers are normally those used to pass parameters and return
     values).  However, some machines have so few registers of certain
     classes that there would not be enough registers to use as spill
     registers if this were done.

     Define `SMALL_REGISTER_CLASSES' on these machines.  When it is
     defined, the compiler allows registers explicitly used in the rtl
     to be used as spill registers but avoids extending the lifetime of
     these registers.

     It is always safe to define this macro, but if you unnecessarily
     define it, you will reduce the amount of optimizations that can be
     performed in some cases.  If you do not define this macro when it
     is required, the compiler will run out of spill registers and
     print a fatal error message.  For most machines, you should not
     define this macro.

`CLASS_LIKELY_SPILLED_P (CLASS)'
     A C expression whose value is nonzero if pseudos that have been
     assigned to registers of class CLASS would likely be spilled
     because registers of CLASS are needed for spill registers.

     The default value of this macro returns 1 if CLASS has exactly one
     register and zero otherwise.  On most machines, this default
     should be used.  Only define this macro to some other expression
     if pseudo allocated by `local-alloc.c' end up in memory because
     their hard registers were needed for spill regisers.  If this
     macro returns nonzero for those classes, those pseudos will only
     be allocated by `global.c', which knows how to reallocate the
     pseudo to another register.  If there would not be another
     register available for reallocation, you should not change the
     definition of this macro since the only effect of such a
     definition would be to slow down register allocation.

`CLASS_MAX_NREGS (CLASS, MODE)'
     A C expression for the maximum number of consecutive registers of
     class CLASS needed to hold a value of mode MODE.

     This is closely related to the macro `HARD_REGNO_NREGS'.  In fact,
     the value of the macro `CLASS_MAX_NREGS (CLASS, MODE)' should be
     the maximum value of `HARD_REGNO_NREGS (REGNO, MODE)' for all
     REGNO values in the class CLASS.

     This macro helps control the handling of multiple-word values in
     the reload pass.

`CLASS_CANNOT_CHANGE_SIZE'
     If defined, a C expression for a class that contains registers
     which the compiler must always access in a mode that is the same
     size as the mode in which it loaded the register, unless neither
     mode is integral.

     For the example, loading 32-bit integer or floating-point objects
     into floating-point registers on the Alpha extends them to 64-bits.
     Therefore loading a 64-bit object and then storing it as a 32-bit
     object does not store the low-order 32-bits, as would be the case
     for a normal register.  Therefore, `alpha.h' defines this macro as
     `FLOAT_REGS'.

   Three other special macros describe which operands fit which
constraint letters.

`CONST_OK_FOR_LETTER_P (VALUE, C)'
     A C expression that defines the machine-dependent operand
     constraint letters that specify particular ranges of integer
     values.  If C is one of those letters, the expression should check
     that VALUE, an integer, is in the appropriate range and return 1
     if so, 0 otherwise.  If C is not one of those letters, the value
     should be 0 regardless of VALUE.

`CONST_DOUBLE_OK_FOR_LETTER_P (VALUE, C)'
     A C expression that defines the machine-dependent operand
     constraint letters that specify particular ranges of
     `const_double' values.

     If C is one of those letters, the expression should check that
     VALUE, an RTX of code `const_double', is in the appropriate range
     and return 1 if so, 0 otherwise.  If C is not one of those
     letters, the value should be 0 regardless of VALUE.

     `const_double' is used for all floating-point constants and for
     `DImode' fixed-point constants.  A given letter can accept either
     or both kinds of values.  It can use `GET_MODE' to distinguish
     between these kinds.

`EXTRA_CONSTRAINT (VALUE, C)'
     A C expression that defines the optional machine-dependent
     constraint letters that can be used to segregate specific types of
     operands, usually memory references, for the target machine.
     Normally this macro will not be defined.  If it is required for a
     particular target machine, it should return 1 if VALUE corresponds
     to the operand type represented by the constraint letter C.  If C
     is not defined as an extra constraint, the value returned should
     be 0 regardless of VALUE.

     For example, on the ROMP, load instructions cannot have their
     output in r0 if the memory reference contains a symbolic address.
     Constraint letter `Q' is defined as representing a memory address
     that does *not* contain a symbolic address.  An alternative is
     specified with a `Q' constraint on the input and `r' on the
     output.  The next alternative specifies `m' on the input and a
     register class that does not include r0 on the output.




Stack Layout and Calling Conventions
====================================

   This describes the stack layout and calling conventions.


Basic Stack Layout
------------------

   Here is the basic stack layout.

`STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD'
     Define this macro if pushing a word onto the stack moves the stack
     pointer to a smaller address.

     When we say, "define this macro if ...," it means that the
     compiler checks this macro only with `#ifdef' so the precise
     definition used does not matter.

`FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD'
     Define this macro if the addresses of local variable slots are at
     negative offsets from the frame pointer.

`ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD'
     Define this macro if successive arguments to a function occupy
     decreasing addresses on the stack.

`STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET'
     Offset from the frame pointer to the first local variable slot to
     be allocated.

     If `FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD', find the next slot's offset by
     subtracting the first slot's length from `STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET'.
     Otherwise, it is found by adding the length of the first slot to
     the value `STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET'.

`STACK_POINTER_OFFSET'
     Offset from the stack pointer register to the first location at
     which outgoing arguments are placed.  If not specified, the
     default value of zero is used.  This is the proper value for most
     machines.

     If `ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD', this is the offset to the location above
     the first location at which outgoing arguments are placed.

`FIRST_PARM_OFFSET (FUNDECL)'
     Offset from the argument pointer register to the first argument's
     address.  On some machines it may depend on the data type of the
     function.

     If `ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD', this is the offset to the location above
     the first argument's address.

`STACK_DYNAMIC_OFFSET (FUNDECL)'
     Offset from the stack pointer register to an item dynamically
     allocated on the stack, e.g., by `alloca'.

     The default value for this macro is `STACK_POINTER_OFFSET' plus the
     length of the outgoing arguments.  The default is correct for most
     machines.  See `function.c' for details.

`DYNAMIC_CHAIN_ADDRESS (FRAMEADDR)'
     A C expression whose value is RTL representing the address in a
     stack frame where the pointer to the caller's frame is stored.
     Assume that FRAMEADDR is an RTL expression for the address of the
     stack frame itself.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is to return the value
     of FRAMEADDR--that is, the stack frame address is also the address
     of the stack word that points to the previous frame.

`SERTUP_FRAME_ADDRESSES ()'
     If defined, a C expression that produces the machine-specific code
     to setup the stack so that arbitrary frames can be accessed.  For
     example, on the Sparc, we must flush all of the register windows
     to the stack before we can access arbitrary stack frames.  This
     macro will seldom need to be defined.

`RETURN_ADDR_RTX (COUNT, FRAMEADDR)'
     A C expression whose value is RTL representing the value of the
     return address for the frame COUNT steps up from the current frame.
     fRAMEADDR is the frame pointer of the COUNT frame, or the frame
     pointer of the COUNT - 1 frame if `RETURN_ADDR_IN_PREVIOUS_FRAME'
     is defined.

`RETURN_ADDR_IN_PREVIOUS_FRAME'
     Define this if the return address of a particular stack frame is
     accessed from the frame pointer of the previous stack frame.




Registers That Address the Stack Frame
--------------------------------------

   This discusses registers that address the stack frame.

`STACK_POINTER_REGNUM'
     The register number of the stack pointer register, which must also
     be a fixed register according to `FIXED_REGISTERS'.  On most
     machines, the hardware determines which register this is.

`FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM'
     The register number of the frame pointer register, which is used to
     access automatic variables in the stack frame.  On some machines,
     the hardware determines which register this is.  On other
     machines, you can choose any register you wish for this purpose.

`HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM'
     On some machines the offset between the frame pointer and starting
     offset of the automatic variables is not known until after register
     allocation has been done (for example, because the saved registers
     are between these two locations).  On those machines, define
     `FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' the number of a special, fixed register to
     be used internally until the offset is known, and define
     `HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' to be actual the hard register number
     used for the frame pointer.

     You should define this macro only in the very rare circumstances
     when it is not possible to calculate the offset between the frame
     pointer and the automatic variables until after register
     allocation has been completed.  When this macro is defined, you
     must also indicate in your definition of `ELIMINABLE_REGS' how to
     eliminate `FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' into either
     `HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' or `STACK_POINTER_REGNUM'.

     Do not define this macro if it would be the same as
     `FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM'.

`ARG_POINTER_REGNUM'
     The register number of the arg pointer register, which is used to
     access the function's argument list.  On some machines, this is
     the same as the frame pointer register.  On some machines, the
     hardware determines which register this is.  On other machines,
     you can choose any register you wish for this purpose.  If this is
     not the same register as the frame pointer register, then you must
     mark it as a fixed register according to `FIXED_REGISTERS', or
     arrange to be able to eliminate it (*note Elimination::.).

`STATIC_CHAIN_REGNUM'
`STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM'
     Register numbers used for passing a function's static chain
     pointer.  If register windows are used, the register number as
     seen by the called function is `STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM',
     while the register number as seen by the calling function is
     `STATIC_CHAIN_REGNUM'.  If these registers are the same,
     `STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM' need not be defined.

     The static chain register need not be a fixed register.

     If the static chain is passed in memory, these macros should not be
     defined; instead, the next two macros should be defined.

`STATIC_CHAIN'
`STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING'
     If the static chain is passed in memory, these macros provide rtx
     giving `mem' expressions that denote where they are stored.
     `STATIC_CHAIN' and `STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING' give the locations as
     seen by the calling and called functions, respectively.  Often the
     former will be at an offset from the stack pointer and the latter
     at an offset from the frame pointer.

     The variables `stack_pointer_rtx', `frame_pointer_rtx', and
     `arg_pointer_rtx' will have been initialized prior to the use of
     these macros and should be used to refer to those items.

     If the static chain is passed in a register, the two previous
     macros should be defined instead.




Eliminating Frame Pointer and Arg Pointer
-----------------------------------------

   This is about eliminating the frame pointer and arg pointer.

`FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED'
     A C expression which is nonzero if a function must have and use a
     frame pointer.  This expression is evaluated  in the reload pass.
     If its value is nonzero the function will have a frame pointer.

     The expression can in principle examine the current function and
     decide according to the facts, but on most machines the constant 0
     or the constant 1 suffices.  Use 0 when the machine allows code to
     be generated with no frame pointer, and doing so saves some time
     or space.  Use 1 when there is no possible advantage to avoiding a
     frame pointer.

     In certain cases, the compiler does not know how to produce valid
     code without a frame pointer.  The compiler recognizes those cases
     and automatically gives the function a frame pointer regardless of
     what `FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED' says.  You don't need to worry about
     them.

     In a function that does not require a frame pointer, the frame
     pointer register can be allocated for ordinary usage, unless you
     mark it as a fixed register.  See `FIXED_REGISTERS' for more
     information.

`INITIAL_FRAME_POINTER_OFFSET (DEPTH-VAR)'
     A C statement to store in the variable DEPTH-VAR the difference
     between the frame pointer and the stack pointer values immediately
     after the function prologue.  The value would be computed from
     information such as the result of `get_frame_size ()' and the
     tables of registers `regs_ever_live' and `call_used_regs'.

     If `ELIMINABLE_REGS' is defined, this macro will be not be used and
     need not be defined.  Otherwise, it must be defined even if
     `FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED' is defined to always be true; in that
     case, you may set DEPTH-VAR to anything.

`ELIMINABLE_REGS'
     If defined, this macro specifies a table of register pairs used to
     eliminate unneeded registers that point into the stack frame.  If
     it is not defined, the only elimination attempted by the compiler
     is to replace references to the frame pointer with references to
     the stack pointer.

     The definition of this macro is a list of structure
     initializations, each of which specifies an original and
     replacement register.

     On some machines, the position of the argument pointer is not
     known until the compilation is completed.  In such a case, a
     separate hard register must be used for the argument pointer.
     This register can be eliminated by replacing it with either the
     frame pointer or the argument pointer, depending on whether or not
     the frame pointer has been eliminated.

     In this case, you might specify:
          #define ELIMINABLE_REGS  \
          {{ARG_POINTER_REGNUM, STACK_POINTER_REGNUM}, \
           {ARG_POINTER_REGNUM, FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM}, \
           {FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM, STACK_POINTER_REGNUM}}

     Note that the elimination of the argument pointer with the stack
     pointer is specified first since that is the preferred elimination.

`CAN_ELIMINATE (FROM-REG, TO-REG)'
     A C expression that returns non-zero if the compiler is allowed to
     try to replace register number FROM-REG with register number
     TO-REG.  This macro need only be defined if `ELIMINABLE_REGS' is
     defined, and will usually be the constant 1, since most of the
     cases preventing register elimination are things that the compiler
     already knows about.

`INITIAL_ELIMINATION_OFFSET (FROM-REG, TO-REG, OFFSET-VAR)'
     This macro is similar to `INITIAL_FRAME_POINTER_OFFSET'.  It
     specifies the initial difference between the specified pair of
     registers.  This macro must be defined if `ELIMINABLE_REGS' is
     defined.

`LONGJMP_RESTORE_FROM_STACK'
     Define this macro if the `longjmp' function restores registers from
     the stack frames, rather than from those saved specifically by
     `setjmp'.  Certain quantities must not be kept in registers across
     a call to `setjmp' on such machines.




Passing Function Arguments on the Stack
---------------------------------------

   The macros in this section control how arguments are passed on the
stack.  See the following section for other macros that control passing
certain arguments in registers.

`PROMOTE_PROTOTYPES'
     Define this macro if an argument declared in a prototype as an
     integral type smaller than `int' should actually be passed as an
     `int'.  In addition to avoiding errors in certain cases of
     mismatch, it also makes for better code on certain machines.

`PUSH_ROUNDING (NPUSHED)'
     A C expression that is the number of bytes actually pushed onto the
     stack when an instruction attempts to push NPUSHED bytes.

     If the target machine does not have a push instruction, do not
     define this macro.  That directs GNU CC to use an alternate
     strategy: to allocate the entire argument block and then store the
     arguments into it.

     On some machines, the definition

          #define PUSH_ROUNDING(BYTES) (BYTES)

     will suffice.  But on other machines, instructions that appear to
     push one byte actually push two bytes in an attempt to maintain
     alignment.  Then the definition should be

          #define PUSH_ROUNDING(BYTES) (((BYTES) + 1) & ~1)

`ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS'
     If defined, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing
     arguments will be computed and placed into the variable
     `current_function_outgoing_args_size'.  No space will be pushed
     onto the stack for each call; instead, the function prologue should
     increase the stack frame size by this amount.

     Defining both `PUSH_ROUNDING' and `ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS' is
     not proper.

`REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE (FNDECL)'
     Define this macro if functions should assume that stack space has
     been allocated for arguments even when their values are passed in
     registers.

     The value of this macro is the size, in bytes, of the area
     reserved for arguments passed in registers for the function
     represented by FNDECL.

     This space can be allocated by the caller, or be a part of the
     machine-dependent stack frame: `OUTGOING_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' says
     which.

`MAYBE_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE'
`FINAL_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE (CONST_SIZE, VAR_SIZE)'
     Define these macros in addition to the one above if functions might
     allocate stack space for arguments even when their values are
     passed in registers.  These should be used when the stack space
     allocated for arguments in registers is not a simple constant
     independent of the function declaration.

     The value of the first macro is the size, in bytes, of the area
     that we should initially assume would be reserved for arguments
     passed in registers.

     The value of the second macro is the actual size, in bytes, of the
     area that will be reserved for arguments passed in registers.
     This takes two arguments: an integer representing the number of
     bytes of fixed sized arguments on the stack, and a tree
     representing the number of bytes of variable sized arguments on
     the stack.

     When these macros are defined, `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' will only be
     called for libcall functions, the current function, or for a
     function being called when it is known that such stack space must
     be allocated.  In each case this value can be easily computed.

     When deciding whether a called function needs such stack space,
     and how much space to reserve, GNU CC uses these two macros
     instead of `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE'.

`OUTGOING_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE'
     Define this if it is the responsibility of the caller to allocate
     the area reserved for arguments passed in registers.

     If `ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS' is defined, this macro controls
     whether the space for these arguments counts in the value of
     `current_function_outgoing_args_size'.

`STACK_PARMS_IN_REG_PARM_AREA'
     Define this macro if `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' is defined, but the
     stack parameters don't skip the area specified by it.

     Normally, when a parameter is not passed in registers, it is
     placed on the stack beyond the `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' area.
     Defining this macro suppresses this behavior and causes the
     parameter to be passed on the stack in its natural location.

`RETURN_POPS_ARGS (FUNTYPE, STACK-SIZE)'
     A C expression that should indicate the number of bytes of its own
     arguments that a function pops on returning, or 0 if the function
     pops no arguments and the caller must therefore pop them all after
     the function returns.

     FUNTYPE is a C variable whose value is a tree node that describes
     the function in question.  Normally it is a node of type
     `FUNCTION_TYPE' that describes the data type of the function.
     From this it is possible to obtain the data types of the value and
     arguments (if known).

     When a call to a library function is being considered, FUNTYPE
     will contain an identifier node for the library function.  Thus, if
     you need to distinguish among various library functions, you can
     do so by their names.  Note that "library function" in this
     context means a function used to perform arithmetic, whose name is
     known specially in the compiler and was not mentioned in the C
     code being compiled.

     STACK-SIZE is the number of bytes of arguments passed on the
     stack.  If a variable number of bytes is passed, it is zero, and
     argument popping will always be the responsibility of the calling
     function.

     On the Vax, all functions always pop their arguments, so the
     definition of this macro is STACK-SIZE.  On the 68000, using the
     standard calling convention, no functions pop their arguments, so
     the value of the macro is always 0 in this case.  But an
     alternative calling convention is available in which functions
     that take a fixed number of arguments pop them but other functions
     (such as `printf') pop nothing (the caller pops all).  When this
     convention is in use, FUNTYPE is examined to determine whether a
     function takes a fixed number of arguments.




Passing Arguments in Registers
------------------------------

   This section describes the macros which let you control how various
types of arguments are passed in registers or how they are arranged in
the stack.

`FUNCTION_ARG (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
     A C expression that controls whether a function argument is passed
     in a register, and which register.

     The arguments are CUM, which summarizes all the previous
     arguments; MODE, the machine mode of the argument; TYPE, the data
     type of the argument as a tree node or 0 if that is not known
     (which happens for C support library functions); and NAMED, which
     is 1 for an ordinary argument and 0 for nameless arguments that
     correspond to `...' in the called function's prototype.

     The value of the expression should either be a `reg' RTX for the
     hard register in which to pass the argument, or zero to pass the
     argument on the stack.

     For machines like the Vax and 68000, where normally all arguments
     are pushed, zero suffices as a definition.

     The usual way to make the ANSI library `stdarg.h' work on a machine
     where some arguments are usually passed in registers, is to cause
     nameless arguments to be passed on the stack instead.  This is done
     by making `FUNCTION_ARG' return 0 whenever NAMED is 0.

     You may use the macro `MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (MODE, TYPE)' in the
     definition of this macro to determine if this argument is of a
     type that must be passed in the stack.  If `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE'
     is not defined and `FUNCTION_ARG' returns non-zero for such an
     argument, the compiler will abort.  If `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' is
     defined, the argument will be computed in the stack and then
     loaded into a register.

`FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
     Define this macro if the target machine has "register windows", so
     that the register in which a function sees an arguments is not
     necessarily the same as the one in which the caller passed the
     argument.

     For such machines, `FUNCTION_ARG' computes the register in which
     the caller passes the value, and `FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG' should be
     defined in a similar fashion to tell the function being called
     where the arguments will arrive.

     If `FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG' is not defined, `FUNCTION_ARG' serves
     both purposes.

`FUNCTION_ARG_PARTIAL_NREGS (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
     A C expression for the number of words, at the beginning of an
     argument, must be put in registers.  The value must be zero for
     arguments that are passed entirely in registers or that are
     entirely pushed on the stack.

     On some machines, certain arguments must be passed partially in
     registers and partially in memory.  On these machines, typically
     the first N words of arguments are passed in registers, and the
     rest on the stack.  If a multi-word argument (a `double' or a
     structure) crosses that boundary, its first few words must be
     passed in registers and the rest must be pushed.  This macro tells
     the compiler when this occurs, and how many of the words should go
     in registers.

     `FUNCTION_ARG' for these arguments should return the first
     register to be used by the caller for this argument; likewise
     `FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG', for the called function.

`FUNCTION_ARG_PASS_BY_REFERENCE (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
     A C expression that indicates when an argument must be passed by
     reference.  If nonzero for an argument, a copy of that argument is
     made in memory and a pointer to the argument is passed instead of
     the argument itself.  The pointer is passed in whatever way is
     appropriate for passing a pointer to that type.

     On machines where `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' is not defined, a suitable
     definition of this macro might be
          #define FUNCTION_ARG_PASS_BY_REFERENCE\
          (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)  \
            MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (MODE, TYPE)

`FUNCTION_ARG_CALLEE_COPIES (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
     If defined, a C expression that indicates when it is the called
     function's responsibility to make a copy of arguments passed by
     invisible reference.  Normally, the caller makes a copy and passes
     the address of the copy to the routine being called.  When
     FUNCTION_ARG_CALLEE_COPIES is defined and is nonzero, the caller
     does not make a copy.  Instead, it passes a pointer to the "live"
     value.  The called function must not modify this value.  If it can
     be determined that the value won't be modified, it need not make a
     copy; otherwise a copy must be made.

`CUMULATIVE_ARGS'
     A C type for declaring a variable that is used as the first
     argument of `FUNCTION_ARG' and other related values.  For some
     target machines, the type `int' suffices and can hold the number
     of bytes of argument so far.

     There is no need to record in `CUMULATIVE_ARGS' anything about the
     arguments that have been passed on the stack.  The compiler has
     other variables to keep track of that.  For target machines on
     which all arguments are passed on the stack, there is no need to
     store anything in `CUMULATIVE_ARGS'; however, the data structure
     must exist and should not be empty, so use `int'.

`INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS (CUM, FNTYPE, LIBNAME)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) for initializing the variable CUM
     for the state at the beginning of the argument list.  The variable
     has type `CUMULATIVE_ARGS'.  The value of FNTYPE is the tree node
     for the data type of the function which will receive the args, or 0
     if the args are to a compiler support library function.

     When processing a call to a compiler support library function,
     LIBNAME identifies which one.  It is a `symbol_ref' rtx which
     contains the name of the function, as a string.  LIBNAME is 0 when
     an ordinary C function call is being processed.  Thus, each time
     this macro is called, either LIBNAME or FNTYPE is nonzero, but
     never both of them at once.

`INIT_CUMULATIVE_INCOMING_ARGS (CUM, FNTYPE, LIBNAME)'
     Like `INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS' but overrides it for the purposes of
     finding the arguments for the function being compiled.  If this
     macro is undefined, `INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS' is used instead.

     The value passed for LIBNAME is always 0, since library routines
     with special calling conventions are never compiled with GNU CC.
     The argument LIBNAME exists for symmetry with
     `INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS'.

`FUNCTION_ARG_ADVANCE (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the summarizer variable
     CUM to advance past an argument in the argument list.  The values
     MODE, TYPE and NAMED describe that argument.  Once this is done,
     the variable CUM is suitable for analyzing the *following*
     argument with `FUNCTION_ARG', etc.

     This macro need not do anything if the argument in question was
     passed on the stack.  The compiler knows how to track the amount
     of stack space used for arguments without any special help.

`FUNCTION_ARG_PADDING (MODE, TYPE)'
     If defined, a C expression which determines whether, and in which
     direction, to pad out an argument with extra space.  The value
     should be of type `enum direction': either `upward' to pad above
     the argument, `downward' to pad below, or `none' to inhibit
     padding.

     The *amount* of padding is always just enough to reach the next
     multiple of `FUNCTION_ARG_BOUNDARY'; this macro does not control
     it.

     This macro has a default definition which is right for most
     systems.  For little-endian machines, the default is to pad
     upward.  For big-endian machines, the default is to pad downward
     for an argument of constant size shorter than an `int', and upward
     otherwise.

`FUNCTION_ARG_BOUNDARY (MODE, TYPE)'
     If defined, a C expression that gives the alignment boundary, in
     bits, of an argument with the specified mode and type.  If it is
     not defined, `PARM_BOUNDARY' is used for all arguments.

`FUNCTION_ARG_REGNO_P (REGNO)'
     A C expression that is nonzero if REGNO is the number of a hard
     register in which function arguments are sometimes passed.  This
     does *not* include implicit arguments such as the static chain and
     the structure-value address.  On many machines, no registers can be
     used for this purpose since all function arguments are pushed on
     the stack.

Options Controlling the Kind of Output
======================================

   Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  The first three
stages apply to an individual source file, and end by producing an
object file; linking combines all the object files (those newly
compiled, and those specified as input) into an executable file.

   For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind
of compilation is done:

`FILE.c'
     C source code which must be preprocessed.

`FILE.i'
     C source code which should not be preprocessed.

`FILE.ii'
     C++ source code which should not be preprocessed.

`FILE.m'
     Objective-C source code.  Note that you must link with the library
     `libobjc.a' to make an Objective-C program work.

`FILE.h'
     C header file (not to be compiled or linked).

`FILE.cc'
`FILE.cxx'
`FILE.cpp'
`FILE.C'
     C++ source code which must be preprocessed.  Note that in `.cxx',
     the last two letters must both be literally `x'.  Likewise, `.C'
     refers to a literal capital C.

`FILE.s'
     Assembler code.

`FILE.S'
     Assembler code which must be preprocessed.

`OTHER'
     An object file to be fed straight into linking.  Any file name
     with no recognized suffix is treated this way.

   You can specify the input language explicitly with the `-x' option:

`-x LANGUAGE'
     Specify explicitly the LANGUAGE for the following input files
     (rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the
     file name suffix).  This option applies to all following input
     files until the next `-x' option.  Possible values for LANGUAGE
     are:
          c  objective-c  c++
          c-header  cpp-output  c++-cpp-output
          assembler  assembler-with-cpp

`-x none'
     Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files
     are handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if
     `-x' has not been used at all).

   If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use `-x'
(or filename suffixes) to tell `gcc' where to start, and one of the
options `-c', `-S', or `-E' to say where `gcc' is to stop.  Note that
some combinations (for example, `-x cpp-output -E' instruct `gcc' to do
nothing at all.

`-c'
     Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
     stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
     object file for each source file.

     By default, the object file name for a source file is made by
     replacing the suffix `.c', `.i', `.s', etc., with `.o'.

     Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly,
     are ignored.

`-S'
     Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The
     output is in the form of an assembler code file for each
     non-assembler input file specified.

     By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
     replacing the suffix `.c', `.i', etc., with `.s'.

     Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.

`-E'
     Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler
     proper.  The output is in the form of preprocessed source code,
     which is sent to the standard output.

     Input files which don't require preprocessing are ignored.

`-o FILE'
     Place output in file FILE.  This applies regardless to whatever
     sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
     an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

     Since only one output file can be specified, it does not make
     sense to use `-o' when compiling more than one input file, unless
     you are producing an executable file as output.

     If `-o' is not specified, the default is to put an executable file
     in `a.out', the object file for `SOURCE.SUFFIX' in `SOURCE.o', its
     assembler file in `SOURCE.s', and all preprocessed C source on
     standard output.

`-v'
     Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the
     stages of compilation.  Also print the version number of the
     compiler driver program and of the preprocessor and the compiler
     proper.

`-pipe'
     Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
     various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems
     where the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the GNU
     assembler has no trouble.




Compiling C++ Programs
======================

   C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes `.C', `.cc',
`cpp', or `.cxx'; preprocessed C++ files use the suffix `.ii'.  GNU CC
recognizes files with these names and compiles them as C++ programs
even if you call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs
(usually with the name `gcc').

   However, C++ programs often require class libraries as well as a
compiler that understands the C++ language--and under some
circumstances, you might want to compile programs from standard input,
or otherwise without a suffix that flags them as C++ programs.  `g++'
is a program that calls GNU CC with the default language set to C++,
and automatically specifies linking against the GNU class library
libg++.  (1) On many systems, the script `g++' is also installed with
the name `c++'.

   When you compile C++ programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for C++ programs.  *Note
Options Controlling C Dialect: C Dialect Options, for explanations of
options for languages related to C.  *Note Options Controlling C++
Dialect: C++ Dialect Options, for explanations of options that are
meaningful only for C++ programs.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1)  Prior to release 2 of the compiler, there was a separate `g++'
compiler.  That version was based on GNU CC, but not integrated with
it.  Versions of `g++' with a `1.XX' version number--for example, `g++'
version 1.37 or 1.42--are much less reliable than the versions
integrated with GCC 2.  Moreover, combining G++ `1.XX' with a version 2
GCC will simply not work.




Options Controlling C Dialect
=============================

   The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as C++ and Objective C) that the compiler accepts:

`-ansi'
     Support all ANSI standard C programs.

     This turns off certain features of GNU C that are incompatible
     with ANSI C, such as the `asm', `inline' and `typeof' keywords, and
     predefined macros such as `unix' and `vax' that identify the type
     of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
     rarely used ANSI trigraph feature, and disallows `$' as part of
     identifiers.

     The alternate keywords `__asm__', `__extension__', `__inline__'
     and `__typeof__' continue to work despite `-ansi'.  You would not
     want to use them in an ANSI C program, of course, but it is useful
     to put them in header files that might be included in compilations
     done with `-ansi'.  Alternate predefined macros such as `__unix__'
     and `__vax__' are also available, with or without `-ansi'.

     The `-ansi' option does not cause non-ANSI programs to be rejected
     gratuitously.  For that, `-pedantic' is required in addition to
     `-ansi'.  *Note Warning Options::.

     The macro `__STRICT_ANSI__' is predefined when the `-ansi' option
     is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain from
     declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
     ANSI standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with
     any programs that might use these names for other things.

     The functions `alloca', `abort', `exit', and `_exit' are not
     builtin functions when `-ansi' is used.

`-fno-asm'
     Do not recognize `asm', `inline' or `typeof' as a keyword.  These
     words may then be used as identifiers.  You can use the keywords
     `__asm__', `__inline__' and `__typeof__' instead.  `-ansi' implies
     `-fno-asm'.

`-fno-builtin'
     Don't recognize builtin functions that do not begin with two
     leading underscores.  Currently, the functions affected include
     `abort', `abs', `alloca', `cos', `exit', `fabs', `ffs', `labs',
     `memcmp', `memcpy', `sin', `sqrt', `strcmp', `strcpy', and
     `strlen'.

     GCC normally generates special code to handle certain builtin
     functions more efficiently; for instance, calls to `alloca' may
     become single instructions that adjust the stack directly, and
     calls to `memcpy' may become inline copy loops.  The resulting
     code is often both smaller and faster, but since the function
     calls no longer appear as such, you cannot set a breakpoint on
     those calls, nor can you change the behavior of the functions by
     linking with a different library.

     The `-ansi' option prevents `alloca' and `ffs' from being builtin
     functions, since these functions do not have an ANSI standard
     meaning.

`-trigraphs'
     Support ANSI C trigraphs.  You don't want to know about this
     brain-damage.  The `-ansi' option implies `-trigraphs'.

`-traditional'
     Attempt to support some aspects of traditional C compilers.
     Specifically:

        * All `extern' declarations take effect globally even if they
          are written inside of a function definition.  This includes
          implicit declarations of functions.

        * The newer keywords `typeof', `inline', `signed', `const' and
          `volatile' are not recognized.  (You can still use the
          alternative keywords such as `__typeof__', `__inline__', and
          so on.)

        * Comparisons between pointers and integers are always allowed.

        * Integer types `unsigned short' and `unsigned char' promote to
          `unsigned int'.

        * Out-of-range floating point literals are not an error.

        * Certain constructs which ANSI regards as a single invalid
          preprocessing number, such as `0xe-0xd', are treated as
          expressions instead.

        * String "constants" are not necessarily constant; they are
          stored in writable space, and identical looking constants are
          allocated separately.  (This is the same as the effect of
          `-fwritable-strings'.)

        * All automatic variables not declared `register' are preserved
          by `longjmp'.  Ordinarily, GNU C follows ANSI C: automatic
          variables not declared `volatile' may be clobbered.

        * The character escape sequences `\x' and `\a' evaluate as the
          literal characters `x' and `a' respectively.  Without
          `-traditional', `\x' is a prefix for the hexadecimal
          representation of a character, and `\a' produces a bell.

        * In C++ programs, assignment to `this' is permitted with
          `-traditional'.  (The option `-fthis-is-variable' also has
          this effect.)

     You may wish to use `-fno-builtin' as well as `-traditional' if
     your program uses names that are normally GNU C builtin functions
     for other purposes of its own.

     You cannot use `-traditional' if you include any header files that
     rely on ANSI C features.  Some vendors are starting to ship
     systems with ANSI C header files and you cannot use `-traditional'
     on such systems to compile files that include any system headers.

`'
     In the preprocessor, comments convert to nothing at all, rather
     than to a space.  This allows traditional token concatenation.

`'
     In preprocessor directive, the `#' symbol must appear as the first
     character of a line.

`'
     In the preprocessor, macro arguments are recognized within string
     constants in a macro definition (and their values are stringified,
     though without additional quote marks, when they appear in such a
     context).  The preprocessor always considers a string constant to
     end at a newline.

`'
     The predefined macro `__STDC__' is not defined when you use
     `-traditional', but `__GNUC__' is (since the GNU extensions which
     `__GNUC__' indicates are not affected by `-traditional').  If you
     need to write header files that work differently depending on
     whether `-traditional' is in use, by testing both of these
     predefined macros you can distinguish four situations: GNU C,
     traditional GNU C, other ANSI C compilers, and other old C
     compilers.  *Note Standard Predefined Macros: (cpp.info)Standard
     Predefined, for more discussion of these and other predefined
     macros.

`'
     The preprocessor considers a string constant to end at a newline
     (unless the newline is escaped with `\').  (Without `-traditional',
     string constants can contain the newline character as typed.)

`-traditional-cpp'
     Attempt to support some aspects of traditional C preprocessors.
     This includes the last five items in the table immediately above,
     but none of the other effects of `-traditional'.

`-fcond-mismatch'
     Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second
     and third arguments.  The value of such an expression is void.

`-funsigned-char'
     Let the type `char' be unsigned, like `unsigned char'.

     Each kind of machine has a default for what `char' should be.  It
     is either like `unsigned char' by default or like `signed char' by
     default.

     Ideally, a portable program should always use `signed char' or
     `unsigned char' when it depends on the signedness of an object.
     But many programs have been written to use plain `char' and expect
     it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
     machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let
     you make such a program work with the opposite default.

     The type `char' is always a distinct type from each of `signed
     char' or `unsigned char', even though its behavior is always just
     like one of those two.

`-fsigned-char'
     Let the type `char' be signed, like `signed char'.

     Note that this is equivalent to `-fno-unsigned-char', which is the
     negative form of `-funsigned-char'.  Likewise, the option
     `-fno-signed-char' is equivalent to `-funsigned-char'.

`-fsigned-bitfields'
`-funsigned-bitfields'
`-fno-signed-bitfields'
`-fno-unsigned-bitfields'
     These options control whether a bitfield is signed or unsigned,
     when the declaration does not use either `signed' or `unsigned'.
     By default, such a bitfield is signed, because this is consistent:
     the basic integer types such as `int' are signed types.

     However, when `-traditional' is used, bitfields are all unsigned
     no matter what.

`-fwritable-strings'
     Store string constants in the writable data segment and don't
     uniquize them.  This is for compatibility with old programs which
     assume they can write into string constants.  The option
     `-traditional' also has this effect.

     Writing into string constants is a very bad idea; "constants"
     should be constant.

`-fallow-single-precision'
     Do not promote single precision math operations to double
     precision, even when compiling with `-traditional'.

     Traditional K&R C promotes all floating point operations to double
     precision, regardless of the sizes of the operands.   On the
     architecture for which you are compiling, single precision may be
     faster than double precision.   If you must use `-traditional',
     but want to use single precision operations when the operands are
     single precision, use this option.   This option has no effect
     when compiling with ANSI or GNU C conventions (the default).




Options Controlling C++ Dialect
===============================

   This section describes the command-line options that are only
meaningful for C++ programs; but you can also use most of the GNU
compiler options regardless of what language your program is in.  For
example, you might compile a file `firstClass.C' like this:

     g++ -g -felide-constructors -O -c firstClass.C

In this example, only `-felide-constructors' is an option meant only
for C++ programs; you can use the other options with any language
supported by GNU CC.

   Here is a list of options that are *only* for compiling C++ programs:

`-fno-access-control'
     Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for
     working around bugs in the access control code.

`-fall-virtual'
     Treat all possible member functions as virtual, implicitly.  All
     member functions (except for constructor functions and `new' or
     `delete' member operators) are treated as virtual functions of the
     class where they appear.

     This does not mean that all calls to these member functions will
     be made through the internal table of virtual functions.  Under
     some circumstances, the compiler can determine that a call to a
     given virtual function can be made directly; in these cases the
     calls are direct in any case.

`-fconserve-space'
     Put uninitialized or runtime-initialized global variables into the
     common segment, as C does.  This saves space in the executable at
     the cost of not diagnosing duplicate definitions.  If your program
     mysteriously crashes after `main()' has completed, you may have an
     object that is being destroyed twice because two definitions were
     merged.

`-fdollars-in-identifiers'
     Accept `$' in identifiers.  You can also explicitly prohibit use of
     `$' with the option `-fno-dollars-in-identifiers'.  (GNU C++
     allows `$' by default on some target systems but not others.)
     Traditional C allowed the character `$' to form part of
     identifiers.  However, ANSI C and C++ forbid `$' in identifiers.

`-fenum-int-equiv'
     Permit implicit conversion of `int' to enumeration types.  Normally
     GNU C++ allows conversion of `enum' to `int', but not the other
     way around.

`-fexternal-templates'
     Cause template instantiations to obey `#pragma interface' and
     `implementation'; template instances are emitted or not according
     to the location of the template definition.  *Note Template
     Instantiation::, for more information.

`-falt-external-templates'
     Similar to -fexternal-templates, but template instances are
     emitted or not according to the place where they are first
     instantiated.  *Note Template Instantiation::, for more
     information.

`-fno-implicit-templates'
     Never emit code for templates which are instantiated implicitly
     (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations.  *Note
     Template Instantiation::, for more information.

`-fhandle-signatures'
     Recognize the `signature' and `sigof' keywords for specifying
     abstract types.  The default (`-fno-handle-signatures') is not to
     recognize them.  *Note Type Abstraction using Signatures: C++
     Signatures.

`-fhuge-objects'
     Support virtual function calls for objects that exceed the size
     representable by a `short int'.  Users should not use this flag by
     default; if you need to use it, the compiler will tell you so.  If
     you compile any of your code with this flag, you must compile
     *all* of your code with this flag (including libg++, if you use
     it).

     This flag is not useful when compiling with -fvtable-thunks.

`-fno-implement-inlines'
     To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
     controlled by `#pragma implementation'.  This will cause linker
     errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are
     called.

`-fmemoize-lookups'
`-fsave-memoized'
     Use heuristics to compile faster.  These heuristics are not
     enabled by default, since they are only effective for certain
     input files.  Other input files compile more slowly.

     The first time the compiler must build a call to a member function
     (or reference to a data member), it must (1) determine whether the
     class implements member functions of that name; (2) resolve which
     member function to call (which involves figuring out what sorts of
     type conversions need to be made); and (3) check the visibility of
     the member function to the caller.  All of this adds up to slower
     compilation.  Normally, the second time a call is made to that
     member function (or reference to that data member), it must go
     through the same lengthy process again.  This means that code like
     this:

          cout << "This " << p << " has " << n << " legs.\n";

     makes six passes through all three steps.  By using a software
     cache, a "hit" significantly reduces this cost.  Unfortunately,
     using the cache introduces another layer of mechanisms which must
     be implemented, and so incurs its own overhead.
     `-fmemoize-lookups' enables the software cache.

     Because access privileges (visibility) to members and member
     functions may differ from one function context to the next, G++
     may need to flush the cache.  With the `-fmemoize-lookups' flag,
     the cache is flushed after every function that is compiled.  The
     `-fsave-memoized' flag enables the same software cache, but when
     the compiler determines that the context of the last function
     compiled would yield the same access privileges of the next
     function to compile, it preserves the cache.  This is most helpful
     when defining many member functions for the same class: with the
     exception of member functions which are friends of other classes,
     each member function has exactly the same access privileges as
     every other, and the cache need not be flushed.

`-fno-strict-prototype'
     Treat a function declaration with no arguments, such as `int foo
     ();', as C would treat it--as saying nothing about the number of
     arguments or their types.  Normally, such a declaration in C++
     means that the function `foo' takes no arguments.

     This option does not work with operator overloading, which places
     constraints on the parameter types.

`-fnonnull-objects'
     Assume that objects reached through references are not null.

     Normally, GNU C++ makes conservative assumptions about objects
     reached through references.  For example, the compiler must check
     that `a' is not null in code like the following:

          obj &a = g ();
          a.f (2);

     Checking that references of this sort have non-null values requires
     extra code, however, and it is unnecessary for many programs.  You
     can use `-fnonnull-objects' to omit the checks for null, if your
     program doesn't require checking.

     This checking is currently only done for conversions to virtual
     base classes.

`-fthis-is-variable'
     Permit assignment to `this'.  The incorporation of user-defined
     free store management into C++ has made assignment to `this' an
     anachronism.  Therefore, by default it is invalid to assign to
     `this' within a class member function; that is, GNU C++ treats
     `this' in a member function of class `X' as a non-lvalue of type
     `X *'.  However, for backwards compatibility, you can make it
     valid with `-fthis-is-variable'.

`-fvtable-thunks'
     Use `thunks' to implement the virtual function dispatch table
     (`vtable').  The traditional (cfront-style) approach to
     implementing vtables was to store a pointer to the function and two
     offsets for adjusting the `this' pointer at the call site.  Newer
     implementations store a single pointer to a `thunk' function which
     does any necessary adjustment and then calls the target function.

     This option also enables a heuristic for controlling emission of
     vtables; if a class has any non-inline virtual functions, the
     vtable will be emitted in the translation unit containing the
     first one of those.

`-nostdinc++'
     Do not search for header files in the standard directories
     specific to C++, but do still search the other standard
     directories.  (This option is used when building libg++.)

`-traditional'
     For C++ programs (in addition to the effects that apply to both C
     and C++), this has the same effect as `-fthis-is-variable'.  *Note
     Options Controlling C Dialect: C Dialect Options.

   In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for C++ programs:

`-fno-default-inline'
     Do not assume `inline' for functions defined inside a class scope.
     *Note Options That Control Optimization: Optimize Options.

`-Wenum-clash'
`-Woverloaded-virtual'
`-Wtemplate-debugging'
     Warnings that apply only to C++ programs.  *Note Options to
     Request or Suppress Warnings: Warning Options.

`+eN'
     Control how virtual function definitions are used, in a fashion
     compatible with `cfront' 1.x.  *Note Options for Code Generation
     Conventions: Code Gen Options.




Options to Request or Suppress Warnings
=======================================

   Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which are
not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there may have
been an error.

   You can request many specific warnings with options beginning `-W',
for example `-Wimplicit' to request warnings on implicit declarations.
Each of these specific warning options also has a negative form
beginning `-Wno-' to turn off warnings; for example, `-Wno-implicit'.
This manual lists only one of the two forms, whichever is not the
default.

   These options control the amount and kinds of warnings produced by
GNU CC:

`-fsyntax-only'
     Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond
     that.

`-w'
     Inhibit all warning messages.

`-Wno-import'
     Inhibit warning messages about the use of `#import'.

`-pedantic'
     Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ANSI standard C; reject
     all programs that use forbidden extensions.

     Valid ANSI standard C programs should compile properly with or
     without this option (though a rare few will require `-ansi').
     However, without this option, certain GNU extensions and
     traditional C features are supported as well.  With this option,
     they are rejected.

     `-pedantic' does not cause warning messages for use of the
     alternate keywords whose names begin and end with `__'.  Pedantic
     warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
     `__extension__'.  However, only system header files should use
     these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
     *Note Alternate Keywords::.

     This option is not intended to be useful; it exists only to satisfy
     pedants who would otherwise claim that GNU CC fails to support the
     ANSI standard.

     Some users try to use `-pedantic' to check programs for strict ANSI
     C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they
     want: it finds some non-ANSI practices, but not all--only those
     for which ANSI C *requires* a diagnostic.

     A feature to report any failure to conform to ANSI C might be
     useful in some instances, but would require considerable
     additional work and would be quite different from `-pedantic'.  We
     recommend, rather, that users take advantage of the extensions of
     GNU C and disregard the limitations of other compilers.  Aside
     from certain supercomputers and obsolete small machines, there is
     less and less reason ever to use any other C compiler other than
     for bootstrapping GNU CC.

`-pedantic-errors'
     Like `-pedantic', except that errors are produced rather than
     warnings.

`-W'
     Print extra warning messages for these events:

        * A nonvolatile automatic variable might be changed by a call to
          `longjmp'.  These warnings as well are possible only in
          optimizing compilation.

          The compiler sees only the calls to `setjmp'.  It cannot know
          where `longjmp' will be called; in fact, a signal handler
          could call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may
          get a warning even when there is in fact no problem because
          `longjmp' cannot in fact be called at the place which would
          cause a problem.

        * A function can return either with or without a value.
          (Falling off the end of the function body is considered
          returning without a value.)  For example, this function would
          evoke such a warning:

               foo (a)
               {
                 if (a > 0)
                   return a;
               }

        * An expression-statement contains no side effects.

        * An unsigned value is compared against zero with `<' or `<='.

        * A comparison like `x<=y<=z' appears; this is equivalent to
          `(x<=y ? 1 : 0) <= z', which is a different interpretation
          from that of ordinary mathematical notation.

        * Storage-class specifiers like `static' are not the first
          things in a declaration.  According to the C Standard, this
          usage is obsolescent.

        * An aggregate has a partly bracketed initializer.  For
          example, the following code would evoke such a warning,
          because braces are missing around the initializer for `x.h':

               struct s { int f, g; };
               struct t { struct s h; int i; };
               struct t x = { 1, 2, 3 };

`-Wimplicit'
     Warn whenever a function or parameter is implicitly declared.

`-Wreturn-type'
     Warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that
     defaults to `int'.  Also warn about any `return' statement with no
     return-value in a function whose return-type is not `void'.

`-Wunused'
     Warn whenever a variable is unused aside from its declaration,
     whenever a function is declared static but never defined, whenever
     a label is declared but not used, and whenever a statement
     computes a result that is explicitly not used.

     To suppress this warning for a local variable or expression,
     simply cast it to void.  This will also work for file-scope
     variables, but if you want to mark them used at the point of
     definition, you can use this macro:

          #define USE(var) \
            static void *const use_##var = (&use_##var, &var, 0)

          USE (string);

`-Wswitch'
     Warn whenever a `switch' statement has an index of enumeral type
     and lacks a `case' for one or more of the named codes of that
     enumeration.  (The presence of a `default' label prevents this
     warning.)  `case' labels outside the enumeration range also
     provoke warnings when this option is used.

`-Wcomment'
     Warn whenever a comment-start sequence `/*' appears in a comment.

`-Wtrigraphs'
     Warn if any trigraphs are encountered (assuming they are enabled).

`-Wformat'
     Check calls to `printf' and `scanf', etc., to make sure that the
     arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
     specified.

`-Wchar-subscripts'
     Warn if an array subscript has type `char'.  This is a common cause
     of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on
     some machines.

`-Wuninitialized'
     An automatic variable is used without first being initialized.

     These warnings are possible only in optimizing compilation,
     because they require data flow information that is computed only
     when optimizing.  If you don't specify `-O', you simply won't get
     these warnings.

     These warnings occur only for variables that are candidates for
     register allocation.  Therefore, they do not occur for a variable
     that is declared `volatile', or whose address is taken, or whose
     size is other than 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.  Also, they do not occur for
     structures, unions or arrays, even when they are in registers.

     Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used
     only to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
     computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the
     warnings are printed.

     These warnings are made optional because GNU CC is not smart
     enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
     despite appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
     this can happen:

          {
            int x;
            switch (y)
              {
              case 1: x = 1;
                break;
              case 2: x = 4;
                break;
              case 3: x = 5;
              }
            foo (x);
          }

     If the value of `y' is always 1, 2 or 3, then `x' is always
     initialized, but GNU CC doesn't know this.  Here is another common
     case:

          {
            int save_y;
            if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
            ...
            if (change_y) y = save_y;
          }

     This has no bug because `save_y' is used only if it is set.

     Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the
     functions you use that never return as `noreturn'.  *Note Function
     Attributes::.

`-Wparentheses'
     Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such as when
     there is an assignment in a context where a truth value is
     expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
     often get confused about.

`-Wenum-clash'
     Warn about conversion between different enumeration types.  (C++
     only).

`-Wtemplate-debugging'
     When using templates in a C++ program, warn if debugging is not yet
     fully available (C++ only).

`-Wreorder (C++ only)'
     Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does
     not match the order in which they must be executed.  For instance:

          struct A {
            int i;
            int j;
            A(): j (0), i (1) { }
          };

     Here the compiler will warn that the member initializers for `i'
     and `j' will be rearranged to match the declaration order of the
     members.

`-Wall'
     All of the above `-W' options combined.  These are all the options
     which pertain to usage that we recommend avoiding and that we
     believe is easy to avoid, even in conjunction with macros.

   The remaining `-W...' options are not implied by `-Wall' because
they warn about constructions that we consider reasonable to use, on
occasion, in clean programs.

`-Wtraditional'
     Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in
     traditional and ANSI C.

        * Macro arguments occurring within string constants in the
          macro body.  These would substitute the argument in
          traditional C, but are part of the constant in ANSI C.

        * A function declared external in one block and then used after
          the end of the block.

        * A `switch' statement has an operand of type `long'.

`-Wshadow'
     Warn whenever a local variable shadows another local variable.

`-Wid-clash-LEN'
     Warn whenever two distinct identifiers match in the first LEN
     characters.  This may help you prepare a program that will compile
     with certain obsolete, brain-damaged compilers.

`-Wlarger-than-LEN'
     Warn whenever an object of larger than LEN bytes is defined.

`-Wpointer-arith'
     Warn about anything that depends on the "size of" a function type
     or of `void'.  GNU C assigns these types a size of 1, for
     convenience in calculations with `void *' pointers and pointers to
     functions.

`-Wbad-function-cast'
     Warn whenever a function call is cast to a non-matching type.  For
     example, warn if `int malloc()' is cast to `anything *'.

`-Wcast-qual'
     Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier
     from the target type.  For example, warn if a `const char *' is
     cast to an ordinary `char *'.

`-Wcast-align'
     Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment
     of the target is increased.  For example, warn if a `char *' is
     cast to an `int *' on machines where integers can only be accessed
     at two- or four-byte boundaries.

`-Wwrite-strings'
     Give string constants the type `const char[LENGTH]' so that
     copying the address of one into a non-`const' `char *' pointer
     will get a warning.  These warnings will help you find at compile
     time code that can try to write into a string constant, but only
     if you have been very careful about using `const' in declarations
     and prototypes.  Otherwise, it will just be a nuisance; this is
     why we did not make `-Wall' request these warnings.

`-Wconversion'
     Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different
     from what would happen to the same argument in the absence of a
     prototype.  This includes conversions of fixed point to floating
     and vice versa, and conversions changing the width or signedness
     of a fixed point argument except when the same as the default
     promotion.

     Also, warn if a negative integer constant expression is implicitly
     converted to an unsigned type.  For example, warn about the
     assignment `x = -1' if `x' is unsigned.  But do not warn about
     explicit casts like `(unsigned) -1'.

`-Waggregate-return'
     Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined
     or called.  (In languages where you can return an array, this also
     elicits a warning.)

`-Wstrict-prototypes'
     Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the
     argument types.  (An old-style function definition is permitted
     without a warning if preceded by a declaration which specifies the
     argument types.)

`-Wmissing-prototypes'
     Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
     declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
     provides a prototype.  The aim is to detect global functions that
     fail to be declared in header files.

`-Wmissing-declarations'
     Warn if a global function is defined without a previous
     declaration.  Do so even if the definition itself provides a
     prototype.  Use this option to detect global functions that are
     not declared in header files.

`-Wredundant-decls'
     Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope,
     even in cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes
     nothing.

`-Wnested-externs'
     Warn if an `extern' declaration is encountered within an function.

`-Winline'
     Warn if a function can not be inlined, and either it was declared
     as inline, or else the `-finline-functions' option was given.

`-Woverloaded-virtual'
     Warn when a derived class function declaration may be an error in
     defining a virtual function (C++ only).  In a derived class, the
     definitions of virtual functions must match the type signature of a
     virtual function declared in the base class.  With this option, the
     compiler warns when you define a function with the same name as a
     virtual function, but with a type signature that does not match any
     declarations from the base class.

`-Wsynth (C++ only)'
     Warn when g++'s synthesis behavior does not match that of cfront.
     For instance:

          struct A {
            operator int ();
            A& operator = (int);
          };

          main ()
          {
            A a,b;
            a = b;
          }

     In this example, g++ will synthesize a default `A& operator =
     (const A&);', while cfront will use the user-defined `operator ='.

`-Werror'
     Make all warnings into errors.



How Scalar Function Values Are Returned
---------------------------------------

   This section discusses the macros that control returning scalars as
values--values that can fit in registers.

`TRADITIONAL_RETURN_FLOAT'
     Define this macro if `-traditional' should not cause functions
     declared to return `float' to convert the value to `double'.

`FUNCTION_VALUE (VALTYPE, FUNC)'
     A C expression to create an RTX representing the place where a
     function returns a value of data type VALTYPE.  VALTYPE is a tree
     node representing a data type.  Write `TYPE_MODE (VALTYPE)' to get
     the machine mode used to represent that type.  On many machines,
     only the mode is relevant.  (Actually, on most machines, scalar
     values are returned in the same place regardless of mode).

     If `PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN' is defined, you must apply the same
     promotion rules specified in `PROMOTE_MODE' if VALTYPE is a scalar
     type.

     If the precise function being called is known, FUNC is a tree node
     (`FUNCTION_DECL') for it; otherwise, FUNC is a null pointer.  This
     makes it possible to use a different value-returning convention
     for specific functions when all their calls are known.

     `FUNCTION_VALUE' is not used for return vales with aggregate data
     types, because these are returned in another way.  See
     `STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM' and related macros, below.

`FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE (VALTYPE, FUNC)'
     Define this macro if the target machine has "register windows" so
     that the register in which a function returns its value is not the
     same as the one in which the caller sees the value.

     For such machines, `FUNCTION_VALUE' computes the register in which
     the caller will see the value.  `FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE' should be
     defined in a similar fashion to tell the function where to put the
     value.

     If `FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE' is not defined, `FUNCTION_VALUE'
     serves both purposes.

     `FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE' is not used for return vales with
     aggregate data types, because these are returned in another way.
     See `STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM' and related macros, below.

`LIBCALL_VALUE (MODE)'
     A C expression to create an RTX representing the place where a
     library function returns a value of mode MODE.  If the precise
     function being called is known, FUNC is a tree node
     (`FUNCTION_DECL') for it; otherwise, FUNC is a null pointer.  This
     makes it possible to use a different value-returning convention
     for specific functions when all their calls are known.

     Note that "library function" in this context means a compiler
     support routine, used to perform arithmetic, whose name is known
     specially by the compiler and was not mentioned in the C code being
     compiled.

     The definition of `LIBRARY_VALUE' need not be concerned aggregate
     data types, because none of the library functions returns such
     types.

`FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P (REGNO)'
     A C expression that is nonzero if REGNO is the number of a hard
     register in which the values of called function may come back.

     A register whose use for returning values is limited to serving as
     the second of a pair (for a value of type `double', say) need not
     be recognized by this macro.  So for most machines, this definition
     suffices:

          #define FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P(N) ((N) == 0)

     If the machine has register windows, so that the caller and the
     called function use different registers for the return value, this
     macro should recognize only the caller's register numbers.

`APPLY_RESULT_SIZE'
     Define this macro if `untyped_call' and `untyped_return' need more
     space than is implied by `FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P' for saving and
     restoring an arbitrary return value.




How Large Values Are Returned
-----------------------------

   When a function value's mode is `BLKmode' (and in some other cases),
the value is not returned according to `FUNCTION_VALUE' (*note Scalar
Return::.).  Instead, the caller passes the address of a block of
memory in which the value should be stored.  This address is called the
"structure value address".

   This section describes how to control returning structure values in
memory.

`RETURN_IN_MEMORY (TYPE)'
     A C expression which can inhibit the returning of certain function
     values in registers, based on the type of value.  A nonzero value
     says to return the function value in memory, just as large
     structures are always returned.  Here TYPE will be a C expression
     of type `tree', representing the data type of the value.

     Note that values of mode `BLKmode' must be explicitly handled by
     this macro.  Also, the option `-fpcc-struct-return' takes effect
     regardless of this macro.  On most systems, it is possible to
     leave the macro undefined; this causes a default definition to be
     used, whose value is the constant 1 for `BLKmode' values, and 0
     otherwise.

     Do not use this macro to indicate that structures and unions
     should always be returned in memory.  You should instead use
     `DEFAULT_PCC_STRUCT_RETURN' to indicate this.

`DEFAULT_PCC_STRUCT_RETURN'
     Define this macro to be 1 if all structure and union return values
     must be in memory.  Since this results in slower code, this should
     be defined only if needed for compatibility with other compilers
     or with an ABI.  If you define this macro to be 0, then the
     conventions used for structure and union return values are decided
     by the `RETURN_IN_MEMORY' macro.

     If not defined, this defaults to the value 1.

`STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM'
     If the structure value address is passed in a register, then
     `STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM' should be the number of that register.

`STRUCT_VALUE'
     If the structure value address is not passed in a register, define
     `STRUCT_VALUE' as an expression returning an RTX for the place
     where the address is passed.  If it returns 0, the address is
     passed as an "invisible" first argument.

`STRUCT_VALUE_INCOMING_REGNUM'
     On some architectures the place where the structure value address
     is found by the called function is not the same place that the
     caller put it.  This can be due to register windows, or it could
     be because the function prologue moves it to a different place.

     If the incoming location of the structure value address is in a
     register, define this macro as the register number.

`STRUCT_VALUE_INCOMING'
     If the incoming location is not a register, then you should define
     `STRUCT_VALUE_INCOMING' as an expression for an RTX for where the
     called function should find the value.  If it should find the
     value on the stack, define this to create a `mem' which refers to
     the frame pointer.  A definition of 0 means that the address is
     passed as an "invisible" first argument.

`PCC_STATIC_STRUCT_RETURN'
     Define this macro if the usual system convention on the target
     machine for returning structures and unions is for the called
     function to return the address of a static variable containing the
     value.

     Do not define this if the usual system convention is for the
     caller to pass an address to the subroutine.

     This macro has effect in `-fpcc-struct-return' mode, but it does
     nothing when you use `-freg-struct-return' mode.




Caller-Saves Register Allocation
--------------------------------

   If you enable it, GNU CC can save registers around function calls.
This makes it possible to use call-clobbered registers to hold
variables that must live across calls.

`DEFAULT_CALLER_SAVES'
     Define this macro if function calls on the target machine do not
     preserve any registers; in other words, if `CALL_USED_REGISTERS'
     has 1 for all registers.  This macro enables `-fcaller-saves' by
     default.  Eventually that option will be enabled by default on all
     machines and both the option and this macro will be eliminated.

`CALLER_SAVE_PROFITABLE (REFS, CALLS)'
     A C expression to determine whether it is worthwhile to consider
     placing a pseudo-register in a call-clobbered hard register and
     saving and restoring it around each function call.  The expression
     should be 1 when this is worth doing, and 0 otherwise.

     If you don't define this macro, a default is used which is good on
     most machines: `4 * CALLS < REFS'.




Function Entry and Exit
-----------------------

   This section describes the macros that output function entry
("prologue") and exit ("epilogue") code.

`FUNCTION_PROLOGUE (FILE, SIZE)'
     A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for entry
     to a function.  The prologue is responsible for setting up the
     stack frame, initializing the frame pointer register, saving
     registers that must be saved, and allocating SIZE additional bytes
     of storage for the local variables.  SIZE is an integer.  FILE is
     a stdio stream to which the assembler code should be output.

     The label for the beginning of the function need not be output by
     this macro.  That has already been done when the macro is run.

     To determine which registers to save, the macro can refer to the
     array `regs_ever_live': element R is nonzero if hard register R is
     used anywhere within the function.  This implies the function
     prologue should save register R, provided it is not one of the
     call-used registers.  (`FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must likewise use
     `regs_ever_live'.)

     On machines that have "register windows", the function entry code
     does not save on the stack the registers that are in the windows,
     even if they are supposed to be preserved by function calls;
     instead it takes appropriate steps to "push" the register stack,
     if any non-call-used registers are used in the function.

     On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the
     function entry code must vary accordingly; it must set up the frame
     pointer if one is wanted, and not otherwise.  To determine whether
     a frame pointer is in wanted, the macro can refer to the variable
     `frame_pointer_needed'.  The variable's value will be 1 at run
     time in a function that needs a frame pointer.  *Note
     Elimination::.

     The function entry code is responsible for allocating any stack
     space required for the function.  This stack space consists of the
     regions listed below.  In most cases, these regions are allocated
     in the order listed, with the last listed region closest to the
     top of the stack (the lowest address if `STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is
     defined, and the highest address if it is not defined).  You can
     use a different order for a machine if doing so is more convenient
     or required for compatibility reasons.  Except in cases where
     required by standard or by a debugger, there is no reason why the
     stack layout used by GCC need agree with that used by other
     compilers for a machine.

        * A region of `current_function_pretend_args_size' bytes of
          uninitialized space just underneath the first argument
          arriving on the stack.  (This may not be at the very start of
          the allocated stack region if the calling sequence has pushed
          anything else since pushing the stack arguments.  But
          usually, on such machines, nothing else has been pushed yet,
          because the function prologue itself does all the pushing.)
          This region is used on machines where an argument may be
          passed partly in registers and partly in memory, and, in some
          cases to support the features in `varargs.h' and `stdargs.h'.

        * An area of memory used to save certain registers used by the
          function.  The size of this area, which may also include
          space for such things as the return address and pointers to
          previous stack frames, is machine-specific and usually
          depends on which registers have been used in the function.
          Machines with register windows often do not require a save
          area.

        * A region of at least SIZE bytes, possibly rounded up to an
          allocation boundary, to contain the local variables of the
          function.  On some machines, this region and the save area
          may occur in the opposite order, with the save area closer to
          the top of the stack.

        * Optionally, when `ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS' is defined, a
          region of `current_function_outgoing_args_size' bytes to be
          used for outgoing argument lists of the function.  *Note
          Stack Arguments::.

     Normally, it is necessary for the macros `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and
     `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' to treat leaf functions specially.  The C
     variable `leaf_function' is nonzero for such a function.

`EXIT_IGNORE_STACK'
     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if the return
     instruction or the function epilogue ignores the value of the stack
     pointer; in other words, if it is safe to delete an instruction to
     adjust the stack pointer before a return from the function.

     Note that this macro's value is relevant only for functions for
     which frame pointers are maintained.  It is never safe to delete a
     final stack adjustment in a function that has no frame pointer,
     and the compiler knows this regardless of `EXIT_IGNORE_STACK'.

`FUNCTION_EPILOGUE (FILE, SIZE)'
     A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for exit
     from a function.  The epilogue is responsible for restoring the
     saved registers and stack pointer to their values when the
     function was called, and returning control to the caller.  This
     macro takes the same arguments as the macro `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE',
     and the registers to restore are determined from `regs_ever_live'
     and `CALL_USED_REGISTERS' in the same way.

     On some machines, there is a single instruction that does all the
     work of returning from the function.  On these machines, give that
     instruction the name `return' and do not define the macro
     `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' at all.

     Do not define a pattern named `return' if you want the
     `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' to be used.  If you want the target switches
     to control whether return instructions or epilogues are used,
     define a `return' pattern with a validity condition that tests the
     target switches appropriately.  If the `return' pattern's validity
     condition is false, epilogues will be used.

     On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the
     function exit code must vary accordingly.  Sometimes the code for
     these two cases is completely different.  To determine whether a
     frame pointer is wanted, the macro can refer to the variable
     `frame_pointer_needed'.  The variable's value will be 1 when
     compiling a function that needs a frame pointer.

     Normally, `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must treat
     leaf functions specially.  The C variable `leaf_function' is
     nonzero for such a function.  *Note Leaf Functions::.

     On some machines, some functions pop their arguments on exit while
     others leave that for the caller to do.  For example, the 68020
     when given `-mrtd' pops arguments in functions that take a fixed
     number of arguments.

     Your definition of the macro `RETURN_POPS_ARGS' decides which
     functions pop their own arguments.  `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' needs to
     know what was decided.  The variable that is called
     `current_function_pops_args' is the number of bytes of its
     arguments that a function should pop.  *Note Scalar Return::.

`DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE'
     Define this macro if the function epilogue contains delay slots to
     which instructions from the rest of the function can be "moved".
     The definition should be a C expression whose value is an integer
     representing the number of delay slots there.

`ELIGIBLE_FOR_EPILOGUE_DELAY (INSN, N)'
     A C expression that returns 1 if INSN can be placed in delay slot
     number N of the epilogue.

     The argument N is an integer which identifies the delay slot now
     being considered (since different slots may have different rules of
     eligibility).  It is never negative and is always less than the
     number of epilogue delay slots (what `DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE'
     returns).  If you reject a particular insn for a given delay slot,
     in principle, it may be reconsidered for a subsequent delay slot.
     Also, other insns may (at least in principle) be considered for
     the so far unfilled delay slot.

     The insns accepted to fill the epilogue delay slots are put in an
     RTL list made with `insn_list' objects, stored in the variable
     `current_function_epilogue_delay_list'.  The insn for the first
     delay slot comes first in the list.  Your definition of the macro
     `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' should fill the delay slots by outputting the
     insns in this list, usually by calling `final_scan_insn'.

     You need not define this macro if you did not define
     `DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE'.




Generating Code for Profiling
-----------------------------

   These macros will help you generate code for profiling.

`FUNCTION_PROFILER (FILE, LABELNO)'
     A C statement or compound statement to output to FILE some
     assembler code to call the profiling subroutine `mcount'.  Before
     calling, the assembler code must load the address of a counter
     variable into a register where `mcount' expects to find the
     address.  The name of this variable is `LP' followed by the number
     LABELNO, so you would generate the name using `LP%d' in a
     `fprintf'.

     The details of how the address should be passed to `mcount' are
     determined by your operating system environment, not by GNU CC.  To
     figure them out, compile a small program for profiling using the
     system's installed C compiler and look at the assembler code that
     results.

`PROFILE_BEFORE_PROLOGUE'
     Define this macro if the code for function profiling should come
     before the function prologue.  Normally, the profiling code comes
     after.

`FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER (FILE, LABELNO)'
     A C statement or compound statement to output to FILE some
     assembler code to initialize basic-block profiling for the current
     object module.  This code should call the subroutine
     `__bb_init_func' once per object module, passing it as its sole
     argument the address of a block allocated in the object module.

     The name of the block is a local symbol made with this statement:

          ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (BUFFER, "LPBX", 0);

     Of course, since you are writing the definition of
     `ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL' as well as that of this macro, you
     can take a short cut in the definition of this macro and use the
     name that you know will result.

     The first word of this block is a flag which will be nonzero if the
     object module has already been initialized.  So test this word
     first, and do not call `__bb_init_func' if the flag is nonzero.

`BLOCK_PROFILER (FILE, BLOCKNO)'
     A C statement or compound statement to increment the count
     associated with the basic block number BLOCKNO.  Basic blocks are
     numbered separately from zero within each compilation.  The count
     associated with block number BLOCKNO is at index BLOCKNO in a
     vector of words; the name of this array is a local symbol made
     with this statement:

          ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (BUFFER, "LPBX", 2);

     Of course, since you are writing the definition of
     `ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL' as well as that of this macro, you
     can take a short cut in the definition of this macro and use the
     name that you know will result.

`BLOCK_PROFILER_CODE'
     A C function or functions which are needed in the library to
     support block profiling.




Implementing the Varargs Macros
===============================

   GNU CC comes with an implementation of `varargs.h' and `stdarg.h'
that work without change on machines that pass arguments on the stack.
Other machines require their own implementations of varargs, and the
two machine independent header files must have conditionals to include
it.

   ANSI `stdarg.h' differs from traditional `varargs.h' mainly in the
calling convention for `va_start'.  The traditional implementation
takes just one argument, which is the variable in which to store the
argument pointer.  The ANSI implementation of `va_start' takes an
additional second argument.  The user is supposed to write the last
named argument of the function here.

   However, `va_start' should not use this argument.  The way to find
the end of the named arguments is with the built-in functions described
below.

`__builtin_saveregs ()'
     Use this built-in function to save the argument registers in
     memory so that the varargs mechanism can access them.  Both ANSI
     and traditional versions of `va_start' must use
     `__builtin_saveregs', unless you use `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' (see
     below) instead.

     On some machines, `__builtin_saveregs' is open-coded under the
     control of the macro `EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS'.  On other machines,
     it calls a routine written in assembler language, found in
     `libgcc2.c'.

     Code generated for the call to `__builtin_saveregs' appears at the
     beginning of the function, as opposed to where the call to
     `__builtin_saveregs' is written, regardless of what the code is.
     This is because the registers must be saved before the function
     starts to use them for its own purposes.

`__builtin_args_info (CATEGORY)'
     Use this built-in function to find the first anonymous arguments in
     registers.

     In general, a machine may have several categories of registers
     used for arguments, each for a particular category of data types.
     (For example, on some machines, floating-point registers are used
     for floating-point arguments while other arguments are passed in
     the general registers.) To make non-varargs functions use the
     proper calling convention, you have defined the `CUMULATIVE_ARGS'
     data type to record how many registers in each category have been
     used so far

     `__builtin_args_info' accesses the same data structure of type
     `CUMULATIVE_ARGS' after the ordinary argument layout is finished
     with it, with CATEGORY specifying which word to access.  Thus, the
     value indicates the first unused register in a given category.

     Normally, you would use `__builtin_args_info' in the implementation
     of `va_start', accessing each category just once and storing the
     value in the `va_list' object.  This is because `va_list' will
     have to update the values, and there is no way to alter the values
     accessed by `__builtin_args_info'.

`__builtin_next_arg (LASTARG)'
     This is the equivalent of `__builtin_args_info', for stack
     arguments.  It returns the address of the first anonymous stack
     argument, as type `void *'. If `ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD', it returns
     the address of the location above the first anonymous stack
     argument.  Use it in `va_start' to initialize the pointer for
     fetching arguments from the stack.  Also use it in `va_start' to
     verify that the second parameter LASTARG is the last named argument
     of the current function.

`__builtin_classify_type (OBJECT)'
     Since each machine has its own conventions for which data types are
     passed in which kind of register, your implementation of `va_arg'
     has to embody these conventions.  The easiest way to categorize the
     specified data type is to use `__builtin_classify_type' together
     with `sizeof' and `__alignof__'.

     `__builtin_classify_type' ignores the value of OBJECT, considering
     only its data type.  It returns an integer describing what kind of
     type that is--integer, floating, pointer, structure, and so on.

     The file `typeclass.h' defines an enumeration that you can use to
     interpret the values of `__builtin_classify_type'.

   These machine description macros help implement varargs:

`EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS (ARGS)'
     If defined, is a C expression that produces the machine-specific
     code for a call to `__builtin_saveregs'.  This code will be moved
     to the very beginning of the function, before any parameter access
     are made.  The return value of this function should be an RTX that
     contains the value to use as the return of `__builtin_saveregs'.

     The argument ARGS is a `tree_list' containing the arguments that
     were passed to `__builtin_saveregs'.

     If this macro is not defined, the compiler will output an ordinary
     call to the library function `__builtin_saveregs'.

`SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS (ARGS_SO_FAR, MODE, TYPE,'
     PRETEND_ARGS_SIZE, SECOND_TIME) This macro offers an alternative
     to using `__builtin_saveregs' and defining the macro
     `EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS'.  Use it to store the anonymous register
     arguments into the stack so that all the arguments appear to have
     been passed consecutively on the stack.  Once this is done, you
     can use the standard implementation of varargs that works for
     machines that pass all their arguments on the stack.

     The argument ARGS_SO_FAR is the `CUMULATIVE_ARGS' data structure,
     containing the values that obtain after processing of the named
     arguments.  The arguments MODE and TYPE describe the last named
     argument--its machine mode and its data type as a tree node.

     The macro implementation should do two things: first, push onto the
     stack all the argument registers *not* used for the named
     arguments, and second, store the size of the data thus pushed into
     the `int'-valued variable whose name is supplied as the argument
     PRETEND_ARGS_SIZE.  The value that you store here will serve as
     additional offset for setting up the stack frame.

     Because you must generate code to push the anonymous arguments at
     compile time without knowing their data types,
     `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' is only useful on machines that have just
     a single category of argument register and use it uniformly for
     all data types.

     If the argument SECOND_TIME is nonzero, it means that the
     arguments of the function are being analyzed for the second time.
     This happens for an inline function, which is not actually
     compiled until the end of the source file.  The macro
     `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' should not generate any instructions in
     this case.




Trampolines for Nested Functions
================================

   A "trampoline" is a small piece of code that is created at run time
when the address of a nested function is taken.  It normally resides on
the stack, in the stack frame of the containing function.  These macros
tell GNU CC how to generate code to allocate and initialize a
trampoline.

   The instructions in the trampoline must do two things: load a
constant address into the static chain register, and jump to the real
address of the nested function.  On CISC machines such as the m68k,
this requires two instructions, a move immediate and a jump.  Then the
two addresses exist in the trampoline as word-long immediate operands.
On RISC machines, it is often necessary to load each address into a
register in two parts.  Then pieces of each address form separate
immediate operands.

   The code generated to initialize the trampoline must store the
variable parts--the static chain value and the function address--into
the immediate operands of the instructions.  On a CISC machine, this is
simply a matter of copying each address to a memory reference at the
proper offset from the start of the trampoline.  On a RISC machine, it
may be necessary to take out pieces of the address and store them
separately.

`TRAMPOLINE_TEMPLATE (FILE)'
     A C statement to output, on the stream FILE, assembler code for a
     block of data that contains the constant parts of a trampoline.
     This code should not include a label--the label is taken care of
     automatically.

`TRAMPOLINE_SECTION'
     The name of a subroutine to switch to the section in which the
     trampoline template is to be placed (*note Sections::.).  The
     default is a value of `readonly_data_section', which places the
     trampoline in the section containing read-only data.

`TRAMPOLINE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bytes of the trampoline, as an
     integer.

`TRAMPOLINE_ALIGNMENT'
     Alignment required for trampolines, in bits.

     If you don't define this macro, the value of `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'
     is used for aligning trampolines.

`INITIALIZE_TRAMPOLINE (ADDR, FNADDR, STATIC_CHAIN)'
     A C statement to initialize the variable parts of a trampoline.
     aDDR is an RTX for the address of the trampoline; FNADDR is an RTX
     for the address of the nested function; STATIC_CHAIN is an RTX for
     the static chain value that should be passed to the function when
     it is called.

`ALLOCATE_TRAMPOLINE (FP)'
     A C expression to allocate run-time space for a trampoline.  The
     expression value should be an RTX representing a memory reference
     to the space for the trampoline.

     If this macro is not defined, by default the trampoline is
     allocated as a stack slot.  This default is right for most
     machines.  The exceptions are machines where it is impossible to
     execute instructions in the stack area.  On such machines, you may
     have to implement a separate stack, using this macro in
     conjunction with `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE'.

     FP points to a data structure, a `struct function', which
     describes the compilation status of the immediate containing
     function of the function which the trampoline is for.  Normally
     (when `ALLOCATE_TRAMPOLINE' is not defined), the stack slot for the
     trampoline is in the stack frame of this containing function.
     Other allocation strategies probably must do something analogous
     with this information.

   Implementing trampolines is difficult on many machines because they
have separate instruction and data caches.  Writing into a stack
location fails to clear the memory in the instruction cache, so when
the program jumps to that location, it executes the old contents.

   Here are two possible solutions.  One is to clear the relevant parts
of the instruction cache whenever a trampoline is set up.  The other is
to make all trampolines identical, by having them jump to a standard
subroutine.  The former technique makes trampoline execution faster; the
latter makes initialization faster.

   To clear the instruction cache when a trampoline is initialized,
define the following macros which describe the shape of the cache.

`INSN_CACHE_SIZE'
     The total size in bytes of the cache.

`INSN_CACHE_LINE_WIDTH'
     The length in bytes of each cache line.  The cache is divided into
     cache lines which are disjoint slots, each holding a contiguous
     chunk of data fetched from memory.  Each time data is brought into
     the cache, an entire line is read at once.  The data loaded into a
     cache line is always aligned on a boundary equal to the line size.

`INSN_CACHE_DEPTH'
     The number of alternative cache lines that can hold any particular
     memory location.

   Alternatively, if the machine has system calls or instructions to
clear the instruction cache directly, you can define the following
macro.

`CLEAR_INSN_CACHE (BEG, END)'
     If defined, expands to a C expression clearing the *instruction
     cache* in the specified interval.  If it is not defined, and the
     macro INSN_CACHE_SIZE is defined, some generic code is generated
     to clear the cache.  The definition of this macro would typically
     be a series of `asm' statements.  Both BEG and END are both pointer
     expressions.

   To use a standard subroutine, define the following macro.  In
addition, you must make sure that the instructions in a trampoline fill
an entire cache line with identical instructions, or else ensure that
the beginning of the trampoline code is always aligned at the same
point in its cache line.  Look in `m68k.h' as a guide.

`TRANSFER_FROM_TRAMPOLINE'
     Define this macro if trampolines need a special subroutine to do
     their work.  The macro should expand to a series of `asm'
     statements which will be compiled with GNU CC.  They go in a
     library function named `__transfer_from_trampoline'.

     If you need to avoid executing the ordinary prologue code of a
     compiled C function when you jump to the subroutine, you can do so
     by placing a special label of your own in the assembler code.  Use
     one `asm' statement to generate an assembler label, and another to
     make the label global.  Then trampolines can use that label to
     jump directly to your special assembler code.




Implicit Calls to Library Routines
==================================

   Here is an explanation of implicit calls to library routines.

`MULSI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for
     multiplication of one signed full-word by another.  If you do not
     define this macro, the default name is used, which is `__mulsi3',
     a function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`DIVSI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for
     division of one signed full-word by another.  If you do not define
     this macro, the default name is used, which is `__divsi3', a
     function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`UDIVSI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for
     division of one unsigned full-word by another.  If you do not
     define this macro, the default name is used, which is `__udivsi3',
     a function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`MODSI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for the
     remainder in division of one signed full-word by another.  If you
     do not define this macro, the default name is used, which is
     `__modsi3', a function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`UMODSI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for the
     remainder in division of one unsigned full-word by another.  If
     you do not define this macro, the default name is used, which is
     `__umodsi3', a function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`MULDI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for
     multiplication of one signed double-word by another.  If you do not
     define this macro, the default name is used, which is `__muldi3',
     a function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`DIVDI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for
     division of one signed double-word by another.  If you do not
     define this macro, the default name is used, which is `__divdi3', a
     function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`UDIVDI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for
     division of one unsigned full-word by another.  If you do not
     define this macro, the default name is used, which is `__udivdi3',
     a function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`MODDI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for the
     remainder in division of one signed double-word by another.  If
     you do not define this macro, the default name is used, which is
     `__moddi3', a function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`UMODDI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for the
     remainder in division of one unsigned full-word by another.  If
     you do not define this macro, the default name is used, which is
     `__umoddi3', a function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`INIT_TARGET_OPTABS'
     Define this macro as a C statement that declares additional library
     routines renames existing ones. `init_optabs' calls this macro
     after initializing all the normal library routines.

`TARGET_EDOM'
     The value of `EDOM' on the target machine, as a C integer constant
     expression.  If you don't define this macro, GNU CC does not
     attempt to deposit the value of `EDOM' into `errno' directly.
     Look in `/usr/include/errno.h' to find the value of `EDOM' on your
     system.

     If you do not define `TARGET_EDOM', then compiled code reports
     domain errors by calling the library function and letting it
     report the error.  If mathematical functions on your system use
     `matherr' when there is an error, then you should leave
     `TARGET_EDOM' undefined so that `matherr' is used normally.

`GEN_ERRNO_RTX'
     Define this macro as a C expression to create an rtl expression
     that refers to the global "variable" `errno'.  (On certain systems,
     `errno' may not actually be a variable.)  If you don't define this
     macro, a reasonable default is used.

`TARGET_MEM_FUNCTIONS'
     Define this macro if GNU CC should generate calls to the System V
     (and ANSI C) library functions `memcpy' and `memset' rather than
     the BSD functions `bcopy' and `bzero'.

`LIBGCC_NEEDS_DOUBLE'
     Define this macro if only `float' arguments cannot be passed to
     library routines (so they must be converted to `double').  This
     macro affects both how library calls are generated and how the
     library routines in `libgcc1.c' accept their arguments.  It is
     useful on machines where floating and fixed point arguments are
     passed differently, such as the i860.

`FLOAT_ARG_TYPE'
     Define this macro to override the type used by the library
     routines to pick up arguments of type `float'.  (By default, they
     use a union of `float' and `int'.)

     The obvious choice would be `float'--but that won't work with
     traditional C compilers that expect all arguments declared as
     `float' to arrive as `double'.  To avoid this conversion, the
     library routines ask for the value as some other type and then
     treat it as a `float'.

     On some systems, no other type will work for this.  For these
     systems, you must use `LIBGCC_NEEDS_DOUBLE' instead, to force
     conversion of the values `double' before they are passed.

`FLOATIFY (PASSED-VALUE)'
     Define this macro to override the way library routines redesignate
     a `float' argument as a `float' instead of the type it was passed
     as.  The default is an expression which takes the `float' field of
     the union.

`FLOAT_VALUE_TYPE'
     Define this macro to override the type used by the library
     routines to return values that ought to have type `float'.  (By
     default, they use `int'.)

     The obvious choice would be `float'--but that won't work with
     traditional C compilers gratuitously convert values declared as
     `float' into `double'.

`INTIFY (FLOAT-VALUE)'
     Define this macro to override the way the value of a
     `float'-returning library routine should be packaged in order to
     return it.  These functions are actually declared to return type
     `FLOAT_VALUE_TYPE' (normally `int').

     These values can't be returned as type `float' because traditional
     C compilers would gratuitously convert the value to a `double'.

     A local variable named `intify' is always available when the macro
     `INTIFY' is used.  It is a union of a `float' field named `f' and
     a field named `i' whose type is `FLOAT_VALUE_TYPE' or `int'.

     If you don't define this macro, the default definition works by
     copying the value through that union.

`nongcc_SI_type'
     Define this macro as the name of the data type corresponding to
     `SImode' in the system's own C compiler.

     You need not define this macro if that type is `long int', as it
     usually is.

`nongcc_word_type'
     Define this macro as the name of the data type corresponding to the
     word_mode in the system's own C compiler.

     You need not define this macro if that type is `long int', as it
     usually is.

`perform_...'
     Define these macros to supply explicit C statements to carry out
     various arithmetic operations on types `float' and `double' in the
     library routines in `libgcc1.c'.  See that file for a full list of
     these macros and their arguments.

     On most machines, you don't need to define any of these macros,
     because the C compiler that comes with the system takes care of
     doing them.

`NEXT_OBJC_RUNTIME'
     Define this macro to generate code for Objective C message sending
     using the calling convention of the NeXT system.  This calling
     convention involves passing the object, the selector and the
     method arguments all at once to the method-lookup library function.

     The default calling convention passes just the object and the
     selector to the lookup function, which returns a pointer to the
     method.




Addressing Modes
================

   This is about addressing modes.

`HAVE_POST_INCREMENT'
     Define this macro if the machine supports post-increment
     addressing.

`HAVE_PRE_INCREMENT'
`HAVE_POST_DECREMENT'
`HAVE_PRE_DECREMENT'
     Similar for other kinds of addressing.

`CONSTANT_ADDRESS_P (X)'
     A C expression that is 1 if the RTX X is a constant which is a
     valid address.  On most machines, this can be defined as
     `CONSTANT_P (X)', but a few machines are more restrictive in which
     constant addresses are supported.

     `CONSTANT_P' accepts integer-values expressions whose values are
     not explicitly known, such as `symbol_ref', `label_ref', and
     `high' expressions and `const' arithmetic expressions, in addition
     to `const_int' and `const_double' expressions.

`MAX_REGS_PER_ADDRESS'
     A number, the maximum number of registers that can appear in a
     valid memory address.  Note that it is up to you to specify a
     value equal to the maximum number that `GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS'
     would ever accept.

`GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS (MODE, X, LABEL)'
     A C compound statement with a conditional `goto LABEL;' executed
     if X (an RTX) is a legitimate memory address on the target machine
     for a memory operand of mode MODE.

     It usually pays to define several simpler macros to serve as
     subroutines for this one.  Otherwise it may be too complicated to
     understand.

     This macro must exist in two variants: a strict variant and a
     non-strict one.  The strict variant is used in the reload pass.  It
     must be defined so that any pseudo-register that has not been
     allocated a hard register is considered a memory reference.  In
     contexts where some kind of register is required, a pseudo-register
     with no hard register must be rejected.

     The non-strict variant is used in other passes.  It must be
     defined to accept all pseudo-registers in every context where some
     kind of register is required.

     Compiler source files that want to use the strict variant of this
     macro define the macro `REG_OK_STRICT'.  You should use an `#ifdef
     REG_OK_STRICT' conditional to define the strict variant in that
     case and the non-strict variant otherwise.

     Subroutines to check for acceptable registers for various purposes
     (one for base registers, one for index registers, and so on) are
     typically among the subroutines used to define
     `GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS'.  Then only these subroutine macros
     need have two variants; the higher levels of macros may be the
     same whether strict or not.

     Normally, constant addresses which are the sum of a `symbol_ref'
     and an integer are stored inside a `const' RTX to mark them as
     constant.  Therefore, there is no need to recognize such sums
     specifically as legitimate addresses.  Normally you would simply
     recognize any `const' as legitimate.

     Usually `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS' is not prepared to handle constant
     sums that are not marked with  `const'.  It assumes that a naked
     `plus' indicates indexing.  If so, then you *must* reject such
     naked constant sums as illegitimate addresses, so that none of
     them will be given to `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS'.

     On some machines, whether a symbolic address is legitimate depends
     on the section that the address refers to.  On these machines,
     define the macro `ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' to store the information
     into the `symbol_ref', and then check for it here.  When you see a
     `const', you will have to look inside it to find the `symbol_ref'
     in order to determine the section.  *Note Assembler Format::.

     The best way to modify the name string is by adding text to the
     beginning, with suitable punctuation to prevent any ambiguity.
     Allocate the new name in `saveable_obstack'.  You will have to
     modify `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' to remove and decode the added text
     and output the name accordingly, and define `STRIP_NAME_ENCODING'
     to access the original name string.

     You can check the information stored here into the `symbol_ref' in
     the definitions of the macros `GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS' and
     `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS'.

`REG_OK_FOR_BASE_P (X)'
     A C expression that is nonzero if X (assumed to be a `reg' RTX) is
     valid for use as a base register.  For hard registers, it should
     always accept those which the hardware permits and reject the
     others.  Whether the macro accepts or rejects pseudo registers
     must be controlled by `REG_OK_STRICT' as described above.  This
     usually requires two variant definitions, of which `REG_OK_STRICT'
     controls the one actually used.

`REG_OK_FOR_INDEX_P (X)'
     A C expression that is nonzero if X (assumed to be a `reg' RTX) is
     valid for use as an index register.

     The difference between an index register and a base register is
     that the index register may be scaled.  If an address involves the
     sum of two registers, neither one of them scaled, then either one
     may be labeled the "base" and the other the "index"; but whichever
     labeling is used must fit the machine's constraints of which
     registers may serve in each capacity.  The compiler will try both
     labelings, looking for one that is valid, and will reload one or
     both registers only if neither labeling works.

`LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS (X, OLDX, MODE, WIN)'
     A C compound statement that attempts to replace X with a valid
     memory address for an operand of mode MODE.  WIN will be a C
     statement label elsewhere in the code; the macro definition may use

          GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS (MODE, X, WIN);

     to avoid further processing if the address has become legitimate.

     X will always be the result of a call to `break_out_memory_refs',
     and OLDX will be the operand that was given to that function to
     produce X.

     The code generated by this macro should not alter the substructure
     of X.  If it transforms X into a more legitimate form, it should
     assign X (which will always be a C variable) a new value.

     It is not necessary for this macro to come up with a legitimate
     address.  The compiler has standard ways of doing so in all cases.
     In fact, it is safe for this macro to do nothing.  But often a
     machine-dependent strategy can generate better code.

`GO_IF_MODE_DEPENDENT_ADDRESS (ADDR, LABEL)'
     A C statement or compound statement with a conditional `goto
     LABEL;' executed if memory address X (an RTX) can have different
     meanings depending on the machine mode of the memory reference it
     is used for or if the address is valid for some modes but not
     others.

     Autoincrement and autodecrement addresses typically have
     mode-dependent effects because the amount of the increment or
     decrement is the size of the operand being addressed.  Some
     machines have other mode-dependent addresses.  Many RISC machines
     have no mode-dependent addresses.

     You may assume that ADDR is a valid address for the machine.

`LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P (X)'
     A C expression that is nonzero if X is a legitimate constant for
     an immediate operand on the target machine.  You can assume that X
     satisfies `CONSTANT_P', so you need not check this.  In fact, `1'
     is a suitable definition for this macro on machines where anything
     `CONSTANT_P' is valid.


Condition Code Status
=====================

   This describes the condition code status.

   The file `conditions.h' defines a variable `cc_status' to describe
how the condition code was computed (in case the interpretation of the
condition code depends on the instruction that it was set by).  This
variable contains the RTL expressions on which the condition code is
currently based, and several standard flags.

   Sometimes additional machine-specific flags must be defined in the
machine description header file.  It can also add additional
machine-specific information by defining `CC_STATUS_MDEP'.

`CC_STATUS_MDEP'
     C code for a data type which is used for declaring the `mdep'
     component of `cc_status'.  It defaults to `int'.

     This macro is not used on machines that do not use `cc0'.

`CC_STATUS_MDEP_INIT'
     A C expression to initialize the `mdep' field to "empty".  The
     default definition does nothing, since most machines don't use the
     field anyway.  If you want to use the field, you should probably
     define this macro to initialize it.

     This macro is not used on machines that do not use `cc0'.

`NOTICE_UPDATE_CC (EXP, INSN)'
     A C compound statement to set the components of `cc_status'
     appropriately for an insn INSN whose body is EXP.  It is this
     macro's responsibility to recognize insns that set the condition
     code as a byproduct of other activity as well as those that
     explicitly set `(cc0)'.

     This macro is not used on machines that do not use `cc0'.

     If there are insns that do not set the condition code but do alter
     other machine registers, this macro must check to see whether they
     invalidate the expressions that the condition code is recorded as
     reflecting.  For example, on the 68000, insns that store in address
     registers do not set the condition code, which means that usually
     `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' can leave `cc_status' unaltered for such insns.
     But suppose that the previous insn set the condition code based
     on location `a4@(102)' and the current insn stores a new value in
     `a4'.  Although the condition code is not changed by this, it will
     no longer be true that it reflects the contents of `a4@(102)'.
     Therefore, `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' must alter `cc_status' in this case
     to say that nothing is known about the condition code value.

     The definition of `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' must be prepared to deal with
     the results of peephole optimization: insns whose patterns are
     `parallel' RTXs containing various `reg', `mem' or constants which
     are just the operands.  The RTL structure of these insns is not
     sufficient to indicate what the insns actually do.  What
     `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' should do when it sees one is just to run
     `CC_STATUS_INIT'.

     A possible definition of `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' is to call a function
     that looks at an attribute (*note Insn Attributes::.) named, for
     example, `cc'.  This avoids having detailed information about
     patterns in two places, the `md' file and in `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC'.

`EXTRA_CC_MODES'
     A list of names to be used for additional modes for condition code
     values in registers (*note Jump Patterns::.).  These names are
     added to `enum machine_mode' and all have class `MODE_CC'.  By
     convention, they should start with `CC' and end with `mode'.

     You should only define this macro if your machine does not use
     `cc0' and only if additional modes are required.

`EXTRA_CC_NAMES'
     A list of C strings giving the names for the modes listed in
     `EXTRA_CC_MODES'.  For example, the Sparc defines this macro and
     `EXTRA_CC_MODES' as

          #define EXTRA_CC_MODES CC_NOOVmode, CCFPmode, CCFPEmode
          #define EXTRA_CC_NAMES "CC_NOOV", "CCFP", "CCFPE"

     This macro is not required if `EXTRA_CC_MODES' is not defined.

`SELECT_CC_MODE (OP, X, Y)'
     Returns a mode from class `MODE_CC' to be used when comparison
     operation code OP is applied to rtx X and Y.  For example, on the
     Sparc, `SELECT_CC_MODE' is defined as (see *note Jump Patterns::.
     for a description of the reason for this definition)

          #define SELECT_CC_MODE(OP,X,Y) \
            (GET_MODE_CLASS (GET_MODE (X)) == MODE_FLOAT          \
             ? ((OP == EQ || OP == NE) ? CCFPmode : CCFPEmode)    \
             : ((GET_CODE (X) == PLUS || GET_CODE (X) == MINUS    \
                 || GET_CODE (X) == NEG) \
                ? CC_NOOVmode : CCmode))

     You need not define this macro if `EXTRA_CC_MODES' is not defined.

`CANONICALIZE_COMPARISON (CODE, OP0, OP1)'
     One some machines not all possible comparisons are defined, but
     you can convert an invalid comparison into a valid one.  For
     example, the Alpha does not have a `GT' comparison, but you can
     use an `LT' comparison instead and swap the order of the operands.

     On such machines, define this macro to be a C statement to do any
     required conversions.  CODE is the initial comparison code and OP0
     and OP1 are the left and right operands of the comparison,
     respectively.  You should modify CODE, OP0, and OP1 as required.

     GNU CC will not assume that the comparison resulting from this
     macro is valid but will see if the resulting insn matches a
     pattern in the `md' file.

     You need not define this macro if it would never change the
     comparison code or operands.

`REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (MODE)'
     A C expression whose value is one if it is always safe to reverse a
     comparison whose mode is MODE.  If `SELECT_CC_MODE' can ever
     return MODE for a floating-point inequality comparison, then
     `REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (MODE)' must be zero.

     You need not define this macro if it would always returns zero or
     if the floating-point format is anything other than
     `IEEE_FLOAT_FORMAT'.  For example, here is the definition used on
     the Sparc, where floating-point inequality comparisons are always
     given `CCFPEmode':

          #define REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE(MODE)  ((MODE) != CCFPEmode)




Describing Relative Costs of Operations
=======================================

   These macros let you describe the relative speed of various
operations on the target machine.

`CONST_COSTS (X, CODE, OUTER_CODE)'
     A part of a C `switch' statement that describes the relative costs
     of constant RTL expressions.  It must contain `case' labels for
     expression codes `const_int', `const', `symbol_ref', `label_ref'
     and `const_double'.  Each case must ultimately reach a `return'
     statement to return the relative cost of the use of that kind of
     constant value in an expression.  The cost may depend on the
     precise value of the constant, which is available for examination
     in X, and the rtx code of the expression in which it is contained,
     found in OUTER_CODE.

     CODE is the expression code--redundant, since it can be obtained
     with `GET_CODE (X)'.

`RTX_COSTS (X, CODE, OUTER_CODE)'
     Like `CONST_COSTS' but applies to nonconstant RTL expressions.
     This can be used, for example, to indicate how costly a multiply
     instruction is.  In writing this macro, you can use the construct
     `COSTS_N_INSNS (N)' to specify a cost equal to N fast
     instructions.  OUTER_CODE is the code of the expression in which X
     is contained.

     This macro is optional; do not define it if the default cost
     assumptions are adequate for the target machine.

`ADDRESS_COST (ADDRESS)'
     An expression giving the cost of an addressing mode that contains
     ADDRESS.  If not defined, the cost is computed from the ADDRESS
     expression and the `CONST_COSTS' values.

     For most CISC machines, the default cost is a good approximation
     of the true cost of the addressing mode.  However, on RISC
     machines, all instructions normally have the same length and
     execution time.  Hence all addresses will have equal costs.

     In cases where more than one form of an address is known, the form
     with the lowest cost will be used.  If multiple forms have the
     same, lowest, cost, the one that is the most complex will be used.

     For example, suppose an address that is equal to the sum of a
     register and a constant is used twice in the same basic block.
     When this macro is not defined, the address will be computed in a
     register and memory references will be indirect through that
     register.  On machines where the cost of the addressing mode
     containing the sum is no higher than that of a simple indirect
     reference, this will produce an additional instruction and
     possibly require an additional register.  Proper specification of
     this macro eliminates this overhead for such machines.

     Similar use of this macro is made in strength reduction of loops.

     ADDRESS need not be valid as an address.  In such a case, the cost
     is not relevant and can be any value; invalid addresses need not be
     assigned a different cost.

     On machines where an address involving more than one register is as
     cheap as an address computation involving only one register,
     defining `ADDRESS_COST' to reflect this can cause two registers to
     be live over a region of code where only one would have been if
     `ADDRESS_COST' were not defined in that manner.  This effect should
     be considered in the definition of this macro.  Equivalent costs
     should probably only be given to addresses with different numbers
     of registers on machines with lots of registers.

     This macro will normally either not be defined or be defined as a
     constant.

`REGISTER_MOVE_COST (FROM, TO)'
     A C expression for the cost of moving data from a register in class
     FROM to one in class TO.  The classes are expressed using the
     enumeration values such as `GENERAL_REGS'.  A value of 4 is the
     default; other values are interpreted relative to that.

     It is not required that the cost always equal 2 when FROM is the
     same as TO; on some machines it is expensive to move between
     registers if they are not general registers.

     If reload sees an insn consisting of a single `set' between two
     hard registers, and if `REGISTER_MOVE_COST' applied to their
     classes returns a value of 2, reload does not check to ensure that
     the constraints of the insn are met.  Setting a cost of other than
     2 will allow reload to verify that the constraints are met.  You
     should do this if the `movM' pattern's constraints do not allow
     such copying.

`MEMORY_MOVE_COST (M)'
     A C expression for the cost of moving data of mode M between a
     register and memory.  A value of 2 is the default; this cost is
     relative to those in `REGISTER_MOVE_COST'.

     If moving between registers and memory is more expensive than
     between two registers, you should define this macro to express the
     relative cost.

`BRANCH_COST'
     A C expression for the cost of a branch instruction.  A value of 1
     is the default; other values are interpreted relative to that.

   Here are additional macros which do not specify precise relative
costs, but only that certain actions are more expensive than GNU CC
would ordinarily expect.

`SLOW_BYTE_ACCESS'
     Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if accessing
     less than a word of memory (i.e. a `char' or a `short') is no
     faster than accessing a word of memory, i.e., if such access
     require more than one instruction or if there is no difference in
     cost between byte and (aligned) word loads.

     When this macro is not defined, the compiler will access a field by
     finding the smallest containing object; when it is defined, a
     fullword load will be used if alignment permits.  Unless bytes
     accesses are faster than word accesses, using word accesses is
     preferable since it may eliminate subsequent memory access if
     subsequent accesses occur to other fields in the same word of the
     structure, but to different bytes.

`SLOW_ZERO_EXTEND'
     Define this macro if zero-extension (of a `char' or `short' to an
     `int') can be done faster if the destination is a register that is
     known to be zero.

     If you define this macro, you must have instruction patterns that
     recognize RTL structures like this:

          (set (strict_low_part (subreg:QI (reg:SI ...) 0)) ...)

     and likewise for `HImode'.

`SLOW_UNALIGNED_ACCESS'
     Define this macro to be the value 1 if unaligned accesses have a
     cost many times greater than aligned accesses, for example if they
     are emulated in a trap handler.

     When this macro is non-zero, the compiler will act as if
     `STRICT_ALIGNMENT' were non-zero when generating code for block
     moves.  This can cause significantly more instructions to be
     produced.  Therefore, do not set this macro non-zero if unaligned
     accesses only add a cycle or two to the time for a memory access.

     If the value of this macro is always zero, it need not be defined.

`DONT_REDUCE_ADDR'
     Define this macro to inhibit strength reduction of memory
     addresses.  (On some machines, such strength reduction seems to do
     harm rather than good.)

`MOVE_RATIO'
     The number of scalar move insns which should be generated instead
     of a string move insn or a library call.  Increasing the value
     will always make code faster, but eventually incurs high cost in
     increased code size.

     If you don't define this, a reasonable default is used.

`NO_FUNCTION_CSE'
     Define this macro if it is as good or better to call a constant
     function address than to call an address kept in a register.

`NO_RECURSIVE_FUNCTION_CSE'
     Define this macro if it is as good or better for a function to call
     itself with an explicit address than to call an address kept in a
     register.

`ADJUST_COST (INSN, LINK, DEP_INSN, COST)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the integer variable COST
     based on the relationship between INSN that is dependent on
     DEP_INSN through the dependence LINK.  The default is to make no
     adjustment to COST.  This can be used for example to specify to
     the scheduler that an output- or anti-dependence does not incur
     the same cost as a data-dependence.




Dividing the Output into Sections (Texts, Data, ...)
====================================================

   An object file is divided into sections containing different types of
data.  In the most common case, there are three sections: the "text
section", which holds instructions and read-only data; the "data
section", which holds initialized writable data; and the "bss section",
which holds uninitialized data.  Some systems have other kinds of
sections.

   The compiler must tell the assembler when to switch sections.  These
macros control what commands to output to tell the assembler this.  You
can also define additional sections.

`TEXT_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     A C expression whose value is a string containing the assembler
     operation that should precede instructions and read-only data.
     Normally `".text"' is right.

`DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     A C expression whose value is a string containing the assembler
     operation to identify the following data as writable initialized
     data.  Normally `".data"' is right.

`SHARED_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     if defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
     assembler operation to identify the following data as shared data.
     If not defined, `DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP' will be used.

`INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     if defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
     assembler operation to identify the following data as
     initialization code.  If not defined, GNU CC will assume such a
     section does not exist.

`EXTRA_SECTIONS'
     A list of names for sections other than the standard two, which are
     `in_text' and `in_data'.  You need not define this macro on a
     system with no other sections (that GCC needs to use).

`EXTRA_SECTION_FUNCTIONS'
     One or more functions to be defined in `varasm.c'.  These
     functions should do jobs analogous to those of `text_section' and
     `data_section', for your additional sections.  Do not define this
     macro if you do not define `EXTRA_SECTIONS'.

`READONLY_DATA_SECTION'
     On most machines, read-only variables, constants, and jump tables
     are placed in the text section.  If this is not the case on your
     machine, this macro should be defined to be the name of a function
     (either `data_section' or a function defined in `EXTRA_SECTIONS')
     that switches to the section to be used for read-only items.

     If these items should be placed in the text section, this macro
     should not be defined.

`SELECT_SECTION (EXP, RELOC)'
     A C statement or statements to switch to the appropriate section
     for output of EXP.  You can assume that EXP is either a `VAR_DECL'
     node or a constant of some sort.  RELOC indicates whether the
     initial value of EXP requires link-time relocations.  Select the
     section by calling `text_section' or one of the alternatives for
     other sections.

     Do not define this macro if you put all read-only variables and
     constants in the read-only data section (usually the text section).

`SELECT_RTX_SECTION (MODE, RTX)'
     A C statement or statements to switch to the appropriate section
     for output of RTX in mode MODE.  You can assume that RTX is some
     kind of constant in RTL.  The argument MODE is redundant except in
     the case of a `const_int' rtx.  Select the section by calling
     `text_section' or one of the alternatives for other sections.

     Do not define this macro if you put all constants in the read-only
     data section.

`JUMP_TABLES_IN_TEXT_SECTION'
     Define this macro if jump tables (for `tablejump' insns) should be
     output in the text section, along with the assembler instructions.
     Otherwise, the readonly data section is used.

     This macro is irrelevant if there is no separate readonly data
     section.

`ENCODE_SECTION_INFO (DECL)'
     Define this macro if references to a symbol must be treated
     differently depending on something about the variable or function
     named by the symbol (such as what section it is in).

     The macro definition, if any, is executed immediately after the
     rtl for DECL has been created and stored in `DECL_RTL (DECL)'.
     The value of the rtl will be a `mem' whose address is a
     `symbol_ref'.

     The usual thing for this macro to do is to record a flag in the
     `symbol_ref' (such as `SYMBOL_REF_FLAG') or to store a modified
     name string in the `symbol_ref' (if one bit is not enough
     information).

`STRIP_NAME_ENCODING (VAR, SYM_NAME)'
     Decode SYM_NAME and store the real name part in VAR, sans the
     characters that encode section info.  Define this macro if
     `ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' alters the symbol's name string.




Position Independent Code
=========================

   This section describes macros that help implement generation of
position independent code.  Simply defining these macros is not enough
to generate valid PIC; you must also add support to the macros
`GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS' and `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS', as well as
`LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS'.  You must modify the definition of `movsi' to do
something appropriate when the source operand contains a symbolic
address.  You may also need to alter the handling of switch statements
so that they use relative addresses.

`PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM'
     The register number of the register used to address a table of
     static data addresses in memory.  In some cases this register is
     defined by a processor's "application binary interface" (ABI).
     When this macro is defined, RTL is generated for this register
     once, as with the stack pointer and frame pointer registers.  If
     this macro is not defined, it is up to the machine-dependent files
     to allocate such a register (if necessary).

     findex PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REG_CALL_CLOBBERED

`PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REG_CALL_CLOBBERED'
     Define this macro if the register defined by
     `PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM' is clobbered by calls.  Do not define
     this macro if `PPIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM' is not defined.

`FINALIZE_PIC'
     By generating position-independent code, when two different
     programs (A and B) share a common library (libC.a), the text of
     the library can be shared whether or not the library is linked at
     the same address for both programs.  In some of these
     environments, position-independent code requires not only the use
     of different addressing modes, but also special code to enable the
     use of these addressing modes.

     The `FINALIZE_PIC' macro serves as a hook to emit these special
     codes once the function is being compiled into assembly code, but
     not before.  (It is not done before, because in the case of
     compiling an inline function, it would lead to multiple PIC
     prologues being included in functions which used inline functions
     and were compiled to assembly language.)

`LEGITIMATE_PIC_OPERAND_P (X)'
     A C expression that is nonzero if X is a legitimate immediate
     operand on the target machine when generating position independent
     code.  You can assume that X satisfies `CONSTANT_P', so you need
     not check this.  You can also assume FLAG_PIC is true, so you need
     not check it either.  You need not define this macro if all
     constants (including `SYMBOL_REF') can be immediate operands when
     generating position independent code.




Defining the Output Assembler Language
======================================

   This section describes macros whose principal purpose is to describe
how to write instructions in assembler language-rather than what the
instructions do.


The Overall Framework of an Assembler File
------------------------------------------

   This describes the overall framework of an assembler file.

`ASM_FILE_START (STREAM)'
     A C expression which outputs to the stdio stream STREAM some
     appropriate text to go at the start of an assembler file.

     Normally this macro is defined to output a line containing
     `#NO_APP', which is a comment that has no effect on most
     assemblers but tells the GNU assembler that it can save time by not
     checking for certain assembler constructs.

     On systems that use SDB, it is necessary to output certain
     commands; see `attasm.h'.

`ASM_FILE_END (STREAM)'
     A C expression which outputs to the stdio stream STREAM some
     appropriate text to go at the end of an assembler file.

     If this macro is not defined, the default is to output nothing
     special at the end of the file.  Most systems don't require any
     definition.

     On systems that use SDB, it is necessary to output certain
     commands; see `attasm.h'.

`ASM_IDENTIFY_GCC (FILE)'
     A C statement to output assembler commands which will identify the
     object file as having been compiled with GNU CC (or another GNU
     compiler).

     If you don't define this macro, the string `gcc_compiled.:' is
     output.  This string is calculated to define a symbol which, on
     BSD systems, will never be defined for any other reason.  GDB
     checks for the presence of this symbol when reading the symbol
     table of an executable.

     On non-BSD systems, you must arrange communication with GDB in
     some other fashion.  If GDB is not used on your system, you can
     define this macro with an empty body.

`ASM_COMMENT_START'
     A C string constant describing how to begin a comment in the target
     assembler language.  The compiler assumes that the comment will
     end at the end of the line.

`ASM_APP_ON'
     A C string constant for text to be output before each `asm'
     statement or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is
     `"#APP"', which is a comment that has no effect on most assemblers
     but tells the GNU assembler that it must check the lines that
     follow for all valid assembler constructs.

`ASM_APP_OFF'
     A C string constant for text to be output after each `asm'
     statement or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is
     `"#NO_APP"', which tells the GNU assembler to resume making the
     time-saving assumptions that are valid for ordinary compiler
     output.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_FILENAME (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement to output COFF information or DWARF debugging
     information which indicates that filename NAME is the current
     source file to the stdio stream STREAM.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output for
     the file format in use is appropriate.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_LINE (STREAM, LINE)'
     A C statement to output DBX or SDB debugging information before
     code for line number LINE of the current source file to the stdio
     stream STREAM.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of debugging
     information for the debugger in use is appropriate.

`ASM_OUTPUT_IDENT (STREAM, STRING)'
     A C statement to output something to the assembler file to handle a
     `#ident' directive containing the text STRING.  If this macro is
     not defined, nothing is output for a `#ident' directive.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SECTION_NAME (STREAM, STRING)'
     A C statement to output something to the assembler file to switch
     to the section contained in STRING.  Some target formats do not
     support arbitrary sections.  Do not define this macro in such
     cases.

     At present this macro is only used to support section attributes.
     When this macro is undefined, section attributes are disabled.

`OBJC_PROLOGUE'
     A C statement to output any assembler statements which are
     required to precede any Objective C object definitions or message
     sending.  The statement is executed only when compiling an
     Objective C program.




Output of Data
--------------

   This describes data output.

`ASM_OUTPUT_LONG_DOUBLE (STREAM, VALUE)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE (STREAM, VALUE)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_FLOAT (STREAM, VALUE)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_THREE_QUARTER_FLOAT (STREAM, VALUE)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_SHORT_FLOAT (STREAM, VALUE)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_BYTE_FLOAT (STREAM, VALUE)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble a floating-point constant of `TFmode',
     `DFmode', `SFmode', `TQFmode', `HFmode', or `QFmode',
     respectively, whose value is VALUE.  VALUE will be a C expression
     of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.  Macros such as
     `REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE' are useful for writing these
     definitions.

`ASM_OUTPUT_QUADRUPLE_INT (STREAM, EXP)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE_INT (STREAM, EXP)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_INT (STREAM, EXP)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_SHORT (STREAM, EXP)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_CHAR (STREAM, EXP)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble an integer of 16, 8, 4, 2 or 1 bytes,
     respectively, whose value is VALUE.  The argument EXP will be an
     RTL expression which represents a constant value.  Use
     `output_addr_const (STREAM, EXP)' to output this value as an
     assembler expression.

     For sizes larger than `UNITS_PER_WORD', if the action of a macro
     would be identical to repeatedly calling the macro corresponding to
     a size of `UNITS_PER_WORD', once for each word, you need not define
     the macro.

`ASM_OUTPUT_BYTE (STREAM, VALUE)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble a single byte containing the number VALUE.

`ASM_BYTE_OP'
     A C string constant giving the pseudo-op to use for a sequence of
     single-byte constants.  If this macro is not defined, the default
     is `"byte"'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII (STREAM, PTR, LEN)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble a string constant containing the LEN bytes
     at PTR.  PTR will be a C expression of type `char *' and LEN a C
     expression of type `int'.

     If the assembler has a `.ascii' pseudo-op as found in the Berkeley
     Unix assembler, do not define the macro `ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_POOL_PROLOGUE (FILE FUNNAME FUNDECL SIZE)'
     A C statement to output assembler commands to define the start of
     the constant pool for a function.  FUNNAME is a string giving the
     name of the function.  Should the return type of the function be
     required, it can be obtained via FUNDECL.  SIZE is the size, in
     bytes, of the constant pool that will be written immediately after
     this call.

     If no constant-pool prefix is required, the usual case, this macro
     need not be defined.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SPECIAL_POOL_ENTRY (FILE, X, MODE, ALIGN, LABELNO, JUMPTO)'
     A C statement (with or without semicolon) to output a constant in
     the constant pool, if it needs special treatment.  (This macro
     need not do anything for RTL expressions that can be output
     normally.)

     The argument FILE is the standard I/O stream to output the
     assembler code on.  X is the RTL expression for the constant to
     output, and MODE is the machine mode (in case X is a `const_int').
     ALIGN is the required alignment for the value X; you should
     output an assembler directive to force this much alignment.

     The argument LABELNO is a number to use in an internal label for
     the address of this pool entry.  The definition of this macro is
     responsible for outputting the label definition at the proper
     place.  Here is how to do this:

          ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL (FILE, "LC", LABELNO);

     When you output a pool entry specially, you should end with a
     `goto' to the label JUMPTO.  This will prevent the same pool entry
     from being output a second time in the usual manner.

     You need not define this macro if it would do nothing.

`IS_ASM_LOGICAL_LINE_SEPARATOR (C)'
     Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if C is used
     as a logical line separator by the assembler.

     If you do not define this macro, the default is that only the
     character `;' is treated as a logical line separator.

`ASM_OPEN_PAREN'
`ASM_CLOSE_PAREN'
     These macros are defined as C string constant, describing the
     syntax in the assembler for grouping arithmetic expressions.  The
     following definitions are correct for most assemblers:

          #define ASM_OPEN_PAREN "("
          #define ASM_CLOSE_PAREN ")"

   These macros are provided by `real.h' for writing the definitions of
`ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE' and the like:

`REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_SINGLE (X, L)'
`REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE (X, L)'
`REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_LONG_DOUBLE (X, L)'
     These translate X, of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE', to the target's
     floating point representation, and store its bit pattern in the
     array of `long int' whose address is L.  The number of elements in
     the output array is determined by the size of the desired target
     floating point data type: 32 bits of it go in each `long int' array
     element.  Each array element holds 32 bits of the result, even if
     `long int' is wider than 32 bits on the host machine.

     The array element values are designed so that you can print them
     out using `fprintf' in the order they should appear in the target
     machine's memory.

`REAL_VALUE_TO_DECIMAL (X, FORMAT, STRING)'
     This macro converts X, of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE', to a decimal
     number and stores it as a string into STRING.  You must pass, as
     STRING, the address of a long enough block of space to hold the
     result.

     The argument FORMAT is a `printf'-specification that serves as a
     suggestion for how to format the output string.




Output of Uninitialized Variables
---------------------------------

   Each of the macros in this section is used to do the whole job of
outputting a single uninitialized variable.

`ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM the assembler definition of a common-label named NAME whose
     size is SIZE bytes.  The variable ROUNDED is the size rounded up
     to whatever alignment the caller wants.

     Use the expression `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the
     name itself; before and after that, output the additional
     assembler syntax for defining the name, and a newline.

     This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
     global variables are output.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' except takes the required alignment as a
     separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used
     in place of `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON', and gives you more flexibility in
     handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is
     specified as the number of bits.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SHARED_COMMON (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
     If defined, it is similar to `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON', except that it
     is used when NAME is shared.  If not defined, `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON'
     will be used.

`ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM the assembler definition of a local-common-label named NAME
     whose size is SIZE bytes.  The variable ROUNDED is the size
     rounded up to whatever alignment the caller wants.

     Use the expression `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the
     name itself; before and after that, output the additional
     assembler syntax for defining the name, and a newline.

     This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
     static variables are output.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_LOCAL (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL' except takes the required alignment as a
     separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used
     in place of `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL', and gives you more flexibility in
     handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is
     specified as the number of bits.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SHARED_LOCAL (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
     If defined, it is similar to `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL', except that it is
     used when NAME is shared.  If not defined, `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL' will
     be used.




Output and Generation of Labels
-------------------------------

   This is about outputting labels.

`ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM the assembler definition of a label named NAME.  Use the
     expression `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name
     itself; before and after that, output the additional assembler
     syntax for defining the name, and a newline.

`ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_NAME (STREAM, NAME, DECL)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the name NAME of a
     function which is being defined.  This macro is responsible for
     outputting the label definition (perhaps using
     `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').  The argument DECL is the `FUNCTION_DECL'
     tree node representing the function.

     If this macro is not defined, then the function name is defined in
     the usual manner as a label (by means of `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').

`ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_SIZE (STREAM, NAME, DECL)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the size of a function
     which is being defined.  The argument NAME is the name of the
     function.  The argument DECL is the `FUNCTION_DECL' tree node
     representing the function.

     If this macro is not defined, then the function size is not
     defined.

`ASM_DECLARE_OBJECT_NAME (STREAM, NAME, DECL)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the name NAME of an
     initialized variable which is being defined.  This macro must
     output the label definition (perhaps using `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').
     The argument DECL is the `VAR_DECL' tree node representing the
     variable.

     If this macro is not defined, then the variable name is defined in
     the usual manner as a label (by means of `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').

`ASM_FINISH_DECLARE_OBJECT (STREAM, DECL, TOPLEVEL, ATEND)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to finish up declaring a variable
     name once the compiler has processed its initializer fully and
     thus has had a chance to determine the size of an array when
     controlled by an initializer.  This is used on systems where it's
     necessary to declare something about the size of the object.

     If you don't define this macro, that is equivalent to defining it
     to do nothing.

`ASM_GLOBALIZE_LABEL (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM some commands that will make the label NAME global; that
     is, available for reference from other files.  Use the expression
     `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name itself; before
     and after that, output the additional assembler syntax for making
     that name global, and a newline.

`ASM_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL (STREAM, DECL, NAME)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the name of an external
     symbol named NAME which is referenced in this compilation but not
     defined.  The value of DECL is the tree node for the declaration.

     This macro need not be defined if it does not need to output
     anything.  The GNU assembler and most Unix assemblers don't
     require anything.

`ASM_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL_LIBCALL (STREAM, SYMREF)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output on STREAM an assembler
     pseudo-op to declare a library function name external.  The name
     of the library function is given by SYMREF, which has type `rtx'
     and is a `symbol_ref'.

     This macro need not be defined if it does not need to output
     anything.  The GNU assembler and most Unix assemblers don't
     require anything.

`ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM a reference in assembler syntax to a label named NAME.
     This should add `_' to the front of the name, if that is customary
     on your operating system, as it is in most Berkeley Unix systems.
     This macro is used in `assemble_name'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL (STREAM, PREFIX, NUM)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM a label whose
     name is made from the string PREFIX and the number NUM.

     It is absolutely essential that these labels be distinct from the
     labels used for user-level functions and variables.  Otherwise,
     certain programs will have name conflicts with internal labels.

     It is desirable to exclude internal labels from the symbol table
     of the object file.  Most assemblers have a naming convention for
     labels that should be excluded; on many systems, the letter `L' at
     the beginning of a label has this effect.  You should find out what
     convention your system uses, and follow it.

     The usual definition of this macro is as follows:

          fprintf (STREAM, "L%s%d:\n", PREFIX, NUM)

`ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (STRING, PREFIX, NUM)'
     A C statement to store into the string STRING a label whose name
     is made from the string PREFIX and the number NUM.

     This string, when output subsequently by `assemble_name', should
     produce the output that `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL' would produce
     with the same PREFIX and NUM.

     If the string begins with `*', then `assemble_name' will output
     the rest of the string unchanged.  It is often convenient for
     `ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL' to use `*' in this way.  If the
     string doesn't start with `*', then `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' gets to
     output the string, and may change it.  (Of course,
     `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' is also part of your machine description, so
     you should know what it does on your machine.)

`ASM_FORMAT_PRIVATE_NAME (OUTVAR, NAME, NUMBER)'
     A C expression to assign to OUTVAR (which is a variable of type
     `char *') a newly allocated string made from the string NAME and
     the number NUMBER, with some suitable punctuation added.  Use
     `alloca' to get space for the string.

     The string will be used as an argument to `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' to
     produce an assembler label for an internal static variable whose
     name is NAME.  Therefore, the string must be such as to result in
     valid assembler code.  The argument NUMBER is different each time
     this macro is executed; it prevents conflicts between
     similarly-named internal static variables in different scopes.

     Ideally this string should not be a valid C identifier, to prevent
     any conflict with the user's own symbols.  Most assemblers allow
     periods or percent signs in assembler symbols; putting at least
     one of these between the name and the number will suffice.

`ASM_OUTPUT_DEF (STREAM, NAME, VALUE)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM assembler code
     which defines (equates) the symbol NAME to have the value VALUE.

     If SET_ASM_OP is defined, a default definition is provided which is
     correct for most systems.

`OBJC_GEN_METHOD_LABEL (BUF, IS_INST, CLASS_NAME, CAT_NAME, SEL_NAME)'
     Define this macro to override the default assembler names used for
     Objective C methods.

     The default name is a unique method number followed by the name of
     the class (e.g. `_1_Foo').  For methods in categories, the name of
     the category is also included in the assembler name (e.g.
     `_1_Foo_Bar').

     These names are safe on most systems, but make debugging difficult
     since the method's selector is not present in the name.
     Therefore, particular systems define other ways of computing names.

     BUF is an expression of type `char *' which gives you a buffer in
     which to store the name; its length is as long as CLASS_NAME,
     CAT_NAME and SEL_NAME put together, plus 50 characters extra.

     The argument IS_INST specifies whether the method is an instance
     method or a class method; CLASS_NAME is the name of the class;
     CAT_NAME is the name of the category (or NULL if the method is not
     in a category); and SEL_NAME is the name of the selector.

     On systems where the assembler can handle quoted names, you can
     use this macro to provide more human-readable names.

How Initialization Functions Are Handled
----------------------------------------

   The compiled code for certain languages includes "constructors"
(also called "initialization routines")--functions to initialize data
in the program when the program is started.  These functions need to be
called before the program is "started"--that is to say, before `main'
is called.

   Compiling some languages generates "destructors" (also called
"termination routines") that should be called when the program
terminates.

   To make the initialization and termination functions work, the
compiler must output something in the assembler code to cause those
functions to be called at the appropriate time.  When you port the
compiler to a new system, you need to specify how to do this.

   There are two major ways that GCC currently supports the execution of
initialization and termination functions.  Each way has two variants.
Much of the structure is common to all four variations.

   The linker must build two lists of these functions--a list of
initialization functions, called `__CTOR_LIST__', and a list of
termination functions, called `__DTOR_LIST__'.

   Each list always begins with an ignored function pointer (which may
hold 0, -1, or a count of the function pointers after it, depending on
the environment).  This is followed by a series of zero or more function
pointers to constructors (or destructors), followed by a function
pointer containing zero.

   Depending on the operating system and its executable file format,
either `crtstuff.c' or `libgcc2.c' traverses these lists at startup
time and exit time.  Constructors are called in forward order of the
list; destructors in reverse order.

   The best way to handle static constructors works only for object file
formats which provide arbitrarily-named sections.  A section is set
aside for a list of constructors, and another for a list of destructors.
Traditionally these are called `.ctors' and `.dtors'.  Each object file
that defines an initialization function also puts a word in the
constructor section to point to that function.  The linker accumulates
all these words into one contiguous `.ctors' section.  Termination
functions are handled similarly.

   To use this method, you need appropriate definitions of the macros
`ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR' and `ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR'.  Usually you can
get them by including `svr4.h'.

   When arbitrary sections are available, there are two variants,
depending upon how the code in `crtstuff.c' is called.  On systems that
support an "init" section which is executed at program startup, parts
of `crtstuff.c' are compiled into that section.  The program is linked
by the `gcc' driver like this:

     ld -o OUTPUT_FILE crtbegin.o ... crtend.o -lgcc

   The head of a function (`__do_global_ctors') appears in the init
section of `crtbegin.o'; the remainder of the function appears in the
init section of `crtend.o'.  The linker will pull these two parts of
the section together, making a whole function.  If any of the user's
object files linked into the middle of it contribute code, then that
code will be executed as part of the body of `__do_global_ctors'.

   To use this variant, you must define the `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP' macro
properly.

   If no init section is available, do not define
`INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP'.  Then `__do_global_ctors' is built into the text
section like all other functions, and resides in `libgcc.a'.  When GCC
compiles any function called `main', it inserts a procedure call to
`__main' as the first executable code after the function prologue.  The
`__main' function, also defined in `libgcc2.c', simply calls
`__do_global_ctors'.

   In file formats that don't support arbitrary sections, there are
again two variants.  In the simplest variant, the GNU linker (GNU `ld')
and an `a.out' format must be used.  In this case,
`ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR' is defined to produce a `.stabs' entry of type
`N_SETT', referencing the name `__CTOR_LIST__', and with the address of
the void function containing the initialization code as its value.  The
GNU linker recognizes this as a request to add the value to a "set";
the values are accumulated, and are eventually placed in the executable
as a vector in the format described above, with a leading (ignored)
count and a trailing zero element.  `ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR' is handled
similarly.  Since no init section is available, the absence of
`INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP' causes the compilation of `main' to call `__main'
as above, starting the initialization process.

   The last variant uses neither arbitrary sections nor the GNU linker.
This is preferable when you want to do dynamic linking and when using
file formats which the GNU linker does not support, such as `ECOFF'.  In
this case, `ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR' does not produce an `N_SETT'
symbol; initialization and termination functions are recognized simply
by their names.  This requires an extra program in the linkage step,
called `collect2'.  This program pretends to be the linker, for use
with GNU CC; it does its job by running the ordinary linker, but also
arranges to include the vectors of initialization and termination
functions.  These functions are called via `__main' as described above.

   Choosing among these configuration options has been simplified by a
set of operating-system-dependent files in the `config' subdirectory.
These files define all of the relevant parameters.  Usually it is
sufficient to include one into your specific machine-dependent
configuration file.  These files are:

`aoutos.h'
     For operating systems using the `a.out' format.

`next.h'
     For operating systems using the `MachO' format.

`svr3.h'
     For System V Release 3 and similar systems using `COFF' format.

`svr4.h'
     For System V Release 4 and similar systems using `ELF' format.

`vms.h'
     For the VMS operating system.

   The following section describes the specific macros that control and
customize the handling of initialization and termination functions.




Macros Controlling Initialization Routines
------------------------------------------

   Here are the macros that control how the compiler handles
initialization and termination functions:

`INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     If defined, a C string constant for the assembler operation to
     identify the following data as initialization code.  If not
     defined, GNU CC will assume such a section does not exist.  When
     you are using special sections for initialization and termination
     functions, this macro also controls how `crtstuff.c' and
     `libgcc2.c' arrange to run the initialization functions.

`HAS_INIT_SECTION'
     If defined, `main' will not call `__main' as described above.
     This macro should be defined for systems that control the contents
     of the init section on a symbol-by-symbol basis, such as OSF/1,
     and should not be defined explicitly for systems that support
     `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP'.

`INVOKE__main'
     If defined, `main' will call `__main' despite the presence of
     `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP'.  This macro should be defined for systems
     where the init section is not actually run automatically, but is
     still useful for collecting the lists of constructors and
     destructors.

`ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR (STREAM, NAME)'
     Define this macro as a C statement to output on the stream STREAM
     the assembler code to arrange to call the function named NAME at
     initialization time.

     Assume that NAME is the name of a C function generated
     automatically by the compiler.  This function takes no arguments.
     Use the function `assemble_name' to output the name NAME; this
     performs any system-specific syntactic transformations such as
     adding an underscore.

     If you don't define this macro, nothing special is output to
     arrange to call the function.  This is correct when the function
     will be called in some other manner--for example, by means of the
     `collect2' program, which looks through the symbol table to find
     these functions by their names.

`ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR (STREAM, NAME)'
     This is like `ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR' but used for termination
     functions rather than initialization functions.

   If your system uses `collect2' as the means of processing
constructors, then that program normally uses `nm' to scan an object
file for constructor functions to be called.  On certain kinds of
systems, you can define these macros to make `collect2' work faster
(and, in some cases, make it work at all):

`OBJECT_FORMAT_COFF'
     Define this macro if the system uses COFF (Common Object File
     Format) object files, so that `collect2' can assume this format
     and scan object files directly for dynamic constructor/destructor
     functions.

`OBJECT_FORMAT_ROSE'
     Define this macro if the system uses ROSE format object files, so
     that `collect2' can assume this format and scan object files
     directly for dynamic constructor/destructor functions.

`REAL_NM_FILE_NAME'
     Define this macro as a C string constant containing the file name
     to use to execute `nm'.  The default is to search the path
     normally for `nm'.

   These macros are effective only in a native compiler; `collect2' as
part of a cross compiler always uses `nm' for the target machine.




Output of Assembler Instructions
--------------------------------

   This describes assembler instruction output.

`REGISTER_NAMES'
     A C initializer containing the assembler's names for the machine
     registers, each one as a C string constant.  This is what
     translates register numbers in the compiler into assembler
     language.

`ADDITIONAL_REGISTER_NAMES'
     If defined, a C initializer for an array of structures containing
     a name and a register number.  This macro defines additional names
     for hard registers, thus allowing the `asm' option in declarations
     to refer to registers using alternate names.

`ASM_OUTPUT_OPCODE (STREAM, PTR)'
     Define this macro if you are using an unusual assembler that
     requires different names for the machine instructions.

     The definition is a C statement or statements which output an
     assembler instruction opcode to the stdio stream STREAM.  The
     macro-operand PTR is a variable of type `char *' which points to
     the opcode name in its "internal" form--the form that is written
     in the machine description.  The definition should output the
     opcode name to STREAM, performing any translation you desire, and
     increment the variable PTR to point at the end of the opcode so
     that it will not be output twice.

     In fact, your macro definition may process less than the entire
     opcode name, or more than the opcode name; but if you want to
     process text that includes `%'-sequences to substitute operands,
     you must take care of the substitution yourself.  Just be sure to
     increment PTR over whatever text should not be output normally.

     If you need to look at the operand values, they can be found as the
     elements of `recog_operand'.

     If the macro definition does nothing, the instruction is output in
     the usual way.

`FINAL_PRESCAN_INSN (INSN, OPVEC, NOPERANDS)'
     If defined, a C statement to be executed just prior to the output
     of assembler code for INSN, to modify the extracted operands so
     they will be output differently.

     Here the argument OPVEC is the vector containing the operands
     extracted from INSN, and NOPERANDS is the number of elements of
     the vector which contain meaningful data for this insn.  The
     contents of this vector are what will be used to convert the insn
     template into assembler code, so you can change the assembler
     output by changing the contents of the vector.

     This macro is useful when various assembler syntaxes share a single
     file of instruction patterns; by defining this macro differently,
     you can cause a large class of instructions to be output
     differently (such as with rearranged operands).  Naturally,
     variations in assembler syntax affecting individual insn patterns
     ought to be handled by writing conditional output routines in
     those patterns.

     If this macro is not defined, it is equivalent to a null statement.

`PRINT_OPERAND (STREAM, X, CODE)'
     A C compound statement to output to stdio stream STREAM the
     assembler syntax for an instruction operand X.  X is an RTL
     expression.

     CODE is a value that can be used to specify one of several ways of
     printing the operand.  It is used when identical operands must be
     printed differently depending on the context.  CODE comes from the
     `%' specification that was used to request printing of the
     operand.  If the specification was just `%DIGIT' then CODE is 0;
     if the specification was `%LTR DIGIT' then CODE is the ASCII code
     for LTR.

     If X is a register, this macro should print the register's name.
     The names can be found in an array `reg_names' whose type is `char
     *[]'.  `reg_names' is initialized from `REGISTER_NAMES'.

     When the machine description has a specification `%PUNCT' (a `%'
     followed by a punctuation character), this macro is called with a
     null pointer for X and the punctuation character for CODE.

`PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P (CODE)'
     A C expression which evaluates to true if CODE is a valid
     punctuation character for use in the `PRINT_OPERAND' macro.  If
     `PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P' is not defined, it means that no
     punctuation characters (except for the standard one, `%') are used
     in this way.

`PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS (STREAM, X)'
     A C compound statement to output to stdio stream STREAM the
     assembler syntax for an instruction operand that is a memory
     reference whose address is X.  X is an RTL expression.

     On some machines, the syntax for a symbolic address depends on the
     section that the address refers to.  On these machines, define the
     macro `ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' to store the information into the
     `symbol_ref', and then check for it here.  *Note Assembler
     Format::.

`DBR_OUTPUT_SEQEND(FILE)'
     A C statement, to be executed after all slot-filler instructions
     have been output.  If necessary, call `dbr_sequence_length' to
     determine the number of slots filled in a sequence (zero if not
     currently outputting a sequence), to decide how many no-ops to
     output, or whatever.

     Don't define this macro if it has nothing to do, but it is helpful
     in reading assembly output if the extent of the delay sequence is
     made explicit (e.g. with white space).

     Note that output routines for instructions with delay slots must be
     prepared to deal with not being output as part of a sequence (i.e.
     when the scheduling pass is not run, or when no slot fillers could
     be found.)  The variable `final_sequence' is null when not
     processing a sequence, otherwise it contains the `sequence' rtx
     being output.

`REGISTER_PREFIX'
`LOCAL_LABEL_PREFIX'
`USER_LABEL_PREFIX'
`IMMEDIATE_PREFIX'
     If defined, C string expressions to be used for the `%R', `%L',
     `%U', and `%I' options of `asm_fprintf' (see `final.c').  These
     are useful when a single `md' file must support multiple assembler
     formats.  In that case, the various `tm.h' files can define these
     macros differently.

`ASSEMBLER_DIALECT'
     If your target supports multiple dialects of assembler language
     (such as different opcodes), define this macro as a C expression
     that gives the numeric index of the assembler langauge dialect to
     use, with zero as the first variant.

     If this macro is defined, you may use
     `{option0|option1|option2...}' constructs in the output templates
     of patterns (*note Output Template::.) or in the first argument of
     `asm_fprintf'.  This construct outputs `option0', `option1' or
     `option2', etc., if the value of `ASSEMBLER_DIALECT' is zero, one
     or two, etc.  Any special characters within these strings retain
     their usual meaning.

     If you do not define this macro, the characters `{', `|' and `}'
     do not have any special meaning when used in templates or operands
     to `asm_fprintf'.

     Define the macros `REGISTER_PREFIX', `LOCAL_LABEL_PREFIX',
     `USER_LABEL_PREFIX' and `IMMEDIATE_PREFIX' if you can express the
     variations in assemble language syntax with that mechanism.  Define
     `ASSEMBLER_DIALECT' and use the `{option0|option1}' syntax if the
     syntax variant are larger and involve such things as different
     opcodes or operand order.

`ASM_OUTPUT_REG_PUSH (STREAM, REGNO)'
     A C expression to output to STREAM some assembler code which will
     push hard register number REGNO onto the stack.  The code need not
     be optimal, since this macro is used only when profiling.

`ASM_OUTPUT_REG_POP (STREAM, REGNO)'
     A C expression to output to STREAM some assembler code which will
     pop hard register number REGNO off of the stack.  The code need
     not be optimal, since this macro is used only when profiling.




Output of Dispatch Tables
-------------------------

   This concerns dispatch tables.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ADDR_DIFF_ELT (STREAM, VALUE, REL)'
     This macro should be provided on machines where the addresses in a
     dispatch table are relative to the table's own address.

     The definition should be a C statement to output to the stdio
     stream STREAM an assembler pseudo-instruction to generate a
     difference between two labels.  VALUE and REL are the numbers of
     two internal labels.  The definitions of these labels are output
     using `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL', and they must be printed in the
     same way here.  For example,

          fprintf (STREAM, "\t.word L%d-L%d\n",
                   VALUE, REL)

`ASM_OUTPUT_ADDR_VEC_ELT (STREAM, VALUE)'
     This macro should be provided on machines where the addresses in a
     dispatch table are absolute.

     The definition should be a C statement to output to the stdio
     stream STREAM an assembler pseudo-instruction to generate a
     reference to a label.  VALUE is the number of an internal label
     whose definition is output using `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL'.  For
     example,

          fprintf (STREAM, "\t.word L%d\n", VALUE)

`ASM_OUTPUT_CASE_LABEL (STREAM, PREFIX, NUM, TABLE)'
     Define this if the label before a jump-table needs to be output
     specially.  The first three arguments are the same as for
     `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL'; the fourth argument is the jump-table
     which follows (a `jump_insn' containing an `addr_vec' or
     `addr_diff_vec').

     This feature is used on system V to output a `swbeg' statement for
     the table.

     If this macro is not defined, these labels are output with
     `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_CASE_END (STREAM, NUM, TABLE)'
     Define this if something special must be output at the end of a
     jump-table.  The definition should be a C statement to be executed
     after the assembler code for the table is written.  It should write
     the appropriate code to stdio stream STREAM.  The argument TABLE
     is the jump-table insn, and NUM is the label-number of the
     preceding label.

     If this macro is not defined, nothing special is output at the end
     of the jump-table.




Assembler Commands for Alignment
--------------------------------

   This describes commands for alignment.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGN_CODE (FILE)'
     A C expression to output text to align the location counter in the
     way that is desirable at a point in the code that is reached only
     by jumping.

     This macro need not be defined if you don't want any special
     alignment to be done at such a time.  Most machine descriptions do
     not currently define the macro.

`ASM_OUTPUT_LOOP_ALIGN (FILE)'
     A C expression to output text to align the location counter in the
     way that is desirable at the beginning of a loop.

     This macro need not be defined if you don't want any special
     alignment to be done at such a time.  Most machine descriptions do
     not currently define the macro.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SKIP (STREAM, NBYTES)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to advance the location counter by NBYTES bytes.
     Those bytes should be zero when loaded.  NBYTES will be a C
     expression of type `int'.

`ASM_NO_SKIP_IN_TEXT'
     Define this macro if `ASM_OUTPUT_SKIP' should not be used in the
     text section because it fails put zeros in the bytes that are
     skipped.  This is true on many Unix systems, where the pseudo-op
     to skip bytes produces no-op instructions rather than zeros when
     used in the text section.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGN (STREAM, POWER)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     command to advance the location counter to a multiple of 2 to the
     POWER bytes.  POWER will be a C expression of type `int'.




Controlling Debugging Information Format
========================================

   This describes how to specify debugging information.


Macros Affecting All Debugging Formats
--------------------------------------

   These macros affect all debugging formats.

`DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER (REGNO)'
     A C expression that returns the DBX register number for the
     compiler register number REGNO.  In simple cases, the value of this
     expression may be REGNO itself.  But sometimes there are some
     registers that the compiler knows about and DBX does not, or vice
     versa.  In such cases, some register may need to have one number in
     the compiler and another for DBX.

     If two registers have consecutive numbers inside GNU CC, and they
     can be used as a pair to hold a multiword value, then they *must*
     have consecutive numbers after renumbering with
     `DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER'.  Otherwise, debuggers will be unable to
     access such a pair, because they expect register pairs to be
     consecutive in their own numbering scheme.

     If you find yourself defining `DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER' in way that
     does not preserve register pairs, then what you must do instead is
     redefine the actual register numbering scheme.

`DEBUGGER_AUTO_OFFSET (X)'
     A C expression that returns the integer offset value for an
     automatic variable having address X (an RTL expression).  The
     default computation assumes that X is based on the frame-pointer
     and gives the offset from the frame-pointer.  This is required for
     targets that produce debugging output for DBX or COFF-style
     debugging output for SDB and allow the frame-pointer to be
     eliminated when the `-g' options is used.

`DEBUGGER_ARG_OFFSET (OFFSET, X)'
     A C expression that returns the integer offset value for an
     argument having address X (an RTL expression).  The nominal offset
     is OFFSET.

`PREFERRED_DEBUGGING_TYPE'
     A C expression that returns the type of debugging output GNU CC
     produces when the user specifies `-g' or `-ggdb'.  Define this if
     you have arranged for GNU CC to support more than one format of
     debugging output.  Currently, the allowable values are `DBX_DEBUG',
     `SDB_DEBUG', `DWARF_DEBUG', and `XCOFF_DEBUG'.

     The value of this macro only affects the default debugging output;
     the user can always get a specific type of output by using
     `-gstabs', `-gcoff', `-gdwarf', or `-gxcoff'.




Specific Options for DBX Output
-------------------------------

   These are specific options for DBX output.

`DBX_DEBUGGING_INFO'
     Define this macro if GNU CC should produce debugging output for DBX
     in response to the `-g' option.

`XCOFF_DEBUGGING_INFO'
     Define this macro if GNU CC should produce XCOFF format debugging
     output in response to the `-g' option.  This is a variant of DBX
     format.

`DEFAULT_GDB_EXTENSIONS'
     Define this macro to control whether GNU CC should by default
     generate GDB's extended version of DBX debugging information
     (assuming DBX-format debugging information is enabled at all).  If
     you don't define the macro, the default is 1: always generate the
     extended information if there is any occasion to.

`DEBUG_SYMS_TEXT'
     Define this macro if all `.stabs' commands should be output while
     in the text section.

`ASM_STABS_OP'
     A C string constant naming the assembler pseudo op to use instead
     of `.stabs' to define an ordinary debugging symbol.  If you don't
     define this macro, `.stabs' is used.  This macro applies only to
     DBX debugging information format.

`ASM_STABD_OP'
     A C string constant naming the assembler pseudo op to use instead
     of `.stabd' to define a debugging symbol whose value is the current
     location.  If you don't define this macro, `.stabd' is used.  This
     macro applies only to DBX debugging information format.

`ASM_STABN_OP'
     A C string constant naming the assembler pseudo op to use instead
     of `.stabn' to define a debugging symbol with no name.  If you
     don't define this macro, `.stabn' is used.  This macro applies
     only to DBX debugging information format.

`DBX_NO_XREFS'
     Define this macro if DBX on your system does not support the
     construct `xsTAGNAME'.  On some systems, this construct is used to
     describe a forward reference to a structure named TAGNAME.  On
     other systems, this construct is not supported at all.

`DBX_CONTIN_LENGTH'
     A symbol name in DBX-format debugging information is normally
     continued (split into two separate `.stabs' directives) when it
     exceeds a certain length (by default, 80 characters).  On some
     operating systems, DBX requires this splitting; on others,
     splitting must not be done.  You can inhibit splitting by defining
     this macro with the value zero.  You can override the default
     splitting-length by defining this macro as an expression for the
     length you desire.

`DBX_CONTIN_CHAR'
     Normally continuation is indicated by adding a `\' character to
     the end of a `.stabs' string when a continuation follows.  To use
     a different character instead, define this macro as a character
     constant for the character you want to use.  Do not define this
     macro if backslash is correct for your system.

`DBX_STATIC_STAB_DATA_SECTION'
     Define this macro if it is necessary to go to the data section
     before outputting the `.stabs' pseudo-op for a non-global static
     variable.

`DBX_TYPE_DECL_STABS_CODE'
     The value to use in the "code" field of the `.stabs' directive for
     a typedef.  The default is `N_LSYM'.

`DBX_STATIC_CONST_VAR_CODE'
     The value to use in the "code" field of the `.stabs' directive for
     a static variable located in the text section.  DBX format does not
     provide any "right" way to do this.  The default is `N_FUN'.

`DBX_REGPARM_STABS_CODE'
     The value to use in the "code" field of the `.stabs' directive for
     a parameter passed in registers.  DBX format does not provide any
     "right" way to do this.  The default is `N_RSYM'.

`DBX_REGPARM_STABS_LETTER'
     The letter to use in DBX symbol data to identify a symbol as a
     parameter passed in registers.  DBX format does not customarily
     provide any way to do this.  The default is `'P''.

`DBX_MEMPARM_STABS_LETTER'
     The letter to use in DBX symbol data to identify a symbol as a
     stack parameter.  The default is `'p''.

`DBX_FUNCTION_FIRST'
     Define this macro if the DBX information for a function and its
     arguments should precede the assembler code for the function.
     Normally, in DBX format, the debugging information entirely
     follows the assembler code.

`DBX_LBRAC_FIRST'
     Define this macro if the `N_LBRAC' symbol for a block should
     precede the debugging information for variables and functions
     defined in that block.  Normally, in DBX format, the `N_LBRAC'
     symbol comes first.

`DBX_BLOCKS_FUNCTION_RELATIVE'
     Define this macro if the value of a symbol describing the scope of
     a block (`N_LBRAC' or `N_RBRAC') should be relative to the start
     of the enclosing function.  Normally, GNU C uses an absolute
     address.




Open-Ended Hooks for DBX Format
-------------------------------

   These are hooks for DBX format.

`DBX_OUTPUT_LBRAC (STREAM, NAME)'
     Define this macro to say how to output to STREAM the debugging
     information for the start of a scope level for variable names.  The
     argument NAME is the name of an assembler symbol (for use with
     `assemble_name') whose value is the address where the scope begins.

`DBX_OUTPUT_RBRAC (STREAM, NAME)'
     Like `DBX_OUTPUT_LBRAC', but for the end of a scope level.

`DBX_OUTPUT_ENUM (STREAM, TYPE)'
     Define this macro if the target machine requires special handling
     to output an enumeration type.  The definition should be a C
     statement (sans semicolon) to output the appropriate information
     to STREAM for the type TYPE.

`DBX_OUTPUT_FUNCTION_END (STREAM, FUNCTION)'
     Define this macro if the target machine requires special output at
     the end of the debugging information for a function.  The
     definition should be a C statement (sans semicolon) to output the
     appropriate information to STREAM.  FUNCTION is the
     `FUNCTION_DECL' node for the function.

`DBX_OUTPUT_STANDARD_TYPES (SYMS)'
     Define this macro if you need to control the order of output of the
     standard data types at the beginning of compilation.  The argument
     SYMS is a `tree' which is a chain of all the predefined global
     symbols, including names of data types.

     Normally, DBX output starts with definitions of the types for
     integers and characters, followed by all the other predefined
     types of the particular language in no particular order.

     On some machines, it is necessary to output different particular
     types first.  To do this, define `DBX_OUTPUT_STANDARD_TYPES' to
     output those symbols in the necessary order.  Any predefined types
     that you don't explicitly output will be output afterward in no
     particular order.

     Be careful not to define this macro so that it works only for C.
     There are no global variables to access most of the built-in
     types, because another language may have another set of types.
     The way to output a particular type is to look through SYMS to see
     if you can find it.  Here is an example:

          {
            tree decl;
            for (decl = syms; decl; decl = TREE_CHAIN (decl))
              if (!strcmp (IDENTIFIER_POINTER (DECL_NAME (decl)),
                           "long int"))
                dbxout_symbol (decl);
            ...
          }

     This does nothing if the expected type does not exist.

     See the function `init_decl_processing' in `c-decl.c' to find the
     names to use for all the built-in C types.

     Here is another way of finding a particular type:

          {
            tree decl;
            for (decl = syms; decl; decl = TREE_CHAIN (decl))
              if (TREE_CODE (decl) == TYPE_DECL
                  && (TREE_CODE (TREE_TYPE (decl))
                      == INTEGER_CST)
                  && TYPE_PRECISION (TREE_TYPE (decl)) == 16
                  && TYPE_UNSIGNED (TREE_TYPE (decl)))
          /* This must be `unsigned short'.  */
                dbxout_symbol (decl);
            ...
          }




File Names in DBX Format
------------------------

   This describes file names in DBX format.

`DBX_WORKING_DIRECTORY'
     Define this if DBX wants to have the current directory recorded in
     each object file.

     Note that the working directory is always recorded if GDB
     extensions are enabled.

`DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_FILENAME (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement to output DBX debugging information to the stdio
     stream STREAM which indicates that file NAME is the main source
     file--the file specified as the input file for compilation.  This
     macro is called only once, at the beginning of compilation.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output for
     DBX debugging information is appropriate.

`DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_DIRECTORY (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement to output DBX debugging information to the stdio
     stream STREAM which indicates that the current directory during
     compilation is named NAME.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output for
     DBX debugging information is appropriate.

`DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_FILE_END (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement to output DBX debugging information at the end of
     compilation of the main source file NAME.

     If you don't define this macro, nothing special is output at the
     end of compilation, which is correct for most machines.

`DBX_OUTPUT_SOURCE_FILENAME (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement to output DBX debugging information to the stdio
     stream STREAM which indicates that file NAME is the current source
     file.  This output is generated each time input shifts to a
     different source file as a result of `#include', the end of an
     included file, or a `#line' command.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output for
     DBX debugging information is appropriate.




Macros for SDB and DWARF Output
-------------------------------

   Here are macros for SDB and DWARF output.

`SDB_DEBUGGING_INFO'
     Define this macro if GNU CC should produce COFF-style debugging
     output for SDB in response to the `-g' option.

`DWARF_DEBUGGING_INFO'
     Define this macro if GNU CC should produce dwarf format debugging
     output in response to the `-g' option.

`PUT_SDB_...'
     Define these macros to override the assembler syntax for the
     special SDB assembler directives.  See `sdbout.c' for a list of
     these macros and their arguments.  If the standard syntax is used,
     you need not define them yourself.

`SDB_DELIM'
     Some assemblers do not support a semicolon as a delimiter, even
     between SDB assembler directives.  In that case, define this macro
     to be the delimiter to use (usually `\n').  It is not necessary to
     define a new set of `PUT_SDB_OP' macros if this is the only change
     required.

`SDB_GENERATE_FAKE'
     Define this macro to override the usual method of constructing a
     dummy name for anonymous structure and union types.  See
     `sdbout.c' for more information.

`SDB_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_REFERENCES'
     Define this macro to allow references to unknown structure, union,
     or enumeration tags to be emitted.  Standard COFF does not allow
     handling of unknown references, MIPS ECOFF has support for it.

`SDB_ALLOW_FORWARD_REFERENCES'
     Define this macro to allow references to structure, union, or
     enumeration tags that have not yet been seen to be handled.  Some
     assemblers choke if forward tags are used, while some require it.




Cross Compilation and Floating Point
====================================

   While all modern machines use 2's complement representation for
integers, there are a variety of representations for floating point
numbers.  This means that in a cross-compiler the representation of
floating point numbers in the compiled program may be different from
that used in the machine doing the compilation.

   Because different representation systems may offer different amounts
of range and precision, the cross compiler cannot safely use the host
machine's floating point arithmetic.  Therefore, floating point
constants must be represented in the target machine's format.  This
means that the cross compiler cannot use `atof' to parse a floating
point constant; it must have its own special routine to use instead.
Also, constant folding must emulate the target machine's arithmetic (or
must not be done at all).

   The macros in the following table should be defined only if you are
cross compiling between different floating point formats.

   Otherwise, don't define them.  Then default definitions will be set
up which use `double' as the data type, `==' to test for equality, etc.

   You don't need to worry about how many times you use an operand of
any of these macros.  The compiler never uses operands which have side
effects.

`REAL_VALUE_TYPE'
     A macro for the C data type to be used to hold a floating point
     value in the target machine's format.  Typically this would be a
     `struct' containing an array of `int'.

`REAL_VALUES_EQUAL (X, Y)'
     A macro for a C expression which compares for equality the two
     values, X and Y, both of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.

`REAL_VALUES_LESS (X, Y)'
     A macro for a C expression which tests whether X is less than Y,
     both values being of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE' and interpreted as
     floating point numbers in the target machine's representation.

`REAL_VALUE_LDEXP (X, SCALE)'
     A macro for a C expression which performs the standard library
     function `ldexp', but using the target machine's floating point
     representation.  Both X and the value of the expression have type
     `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.  The second argument, SCALE, is an integer.

`REAL_VALUE_FIX (X)'
     A macro whose definition is a C expression to convert the
     target-machine floating point value X to a signed integer.  X has
     type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.

`REAL_VALUE_UNSIGNED_FIX (X)'
     A macro whose definition is a C expression to convert the
     target-machine floating point value X to an unsigned integer.  X
     has type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.

`REAL_VALUE_RNDZINT (X)'
     A macro whose definition is a C expression to round the
     target-machine floating point value X towards zero to an integer
     value (but still as a floating point number).  X has type
     `REAL_VALUE_TYPE', and so does the value.

`REAL_VALUE_UNSIGNED_RNDZINT (X)'
     A macro whose definition is a C expression to round the
     target-machine floating point value X towards zero to an unsigned
     integer value (but still represented as a floating point number).
     x has type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE', and so does the value.

`REAL_VALUE_ATOF (STRING, MODE)'
     A macro for a C expression which converts STRING, an expression of
     type `char *', into a floating point number in the target machine's
     representation for mode MODE.  The value has type
     `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.

`REAL_INFINITY'
     Define this macro if infinity is a possible floating point value,
     and therefore division by 0 is legitimate.

`REAL_VALUE_ISINF (X)'
     A macro for a C expression which determines whether X, a floating
     point value, is infinity.  The value has type `int'.  By default,
     this is defined to call `isinf'.

`REAL_VALUE_ISNAN (X)'
     A macro for a C expression which determines whether X, a floating
     point value, is a "nan" (not-a-number).  The value has type `int'.
     By default, this is defined to call `isnan'.

   Define the following additional macros if you want to make floating
point constant folding work while cross compiling.  If you don't define
them, cross compilation is still possible, but constant folding will
not happen for floating point values.

`REAL_ARITHMETIC (OUTPUT, CODE, X, Y)'
     A macro for a C statement which calculates an arithmetic operation
     of the two floating point values X and Y, both of type
     `REAL_VALUE_TYPE' in the target machine's representation, to
     produce a result of the same type and representation which is
     stored in OUTPUT (which will be a variable).

     The operation to be performed is specified by CODE, a tree code
     which will always be one of the following: `PLUS_EXPR',
     `MINUS_EXPR', `MULT_EXPR', `RDIV_EXPR', `MAX_EXPR', `MIN_EXPR'.

     The expansion of this macro is responsible for checking for
     overflow.  If overflow happens, the macro expansion should execute
     the statement `return 0;', which indicates the inability to
     perform the arithmetic operation requested.

`REAL_VALUE_NEGATE (X)'
     A macro for a C expression which returns the negative of the
     floating point value X.  Both X and the value of the expression
     have type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE' and are in the target machine's
     floating point representation.

     There is no way for this macro to report overflow, since overflow
     can't happen in the negation operation.

`REAL_VALUE_TRUNCATE (MODE, X)'
     A macro for a C expression which converts the floating point value
     X to mode MODE.

     Both X and the value of the expression are in the target machine's
     floating point representation and have type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.
     However, the value should have an appropriate bit pattern to be
     output properly as a floating constant whose precision accords
     with mode MODE.

     There is no way for this macro to report overflow.

`REAL_VALUE_TO_INT (LOW, HIGH, X)'
     A macro for a C expression which converts a floating point value X
     into a double-precision integer which is then stored into LOW and
     HIGH, two variables of type INT.

`REAL_VALUE_FROM_INT (X, LOW, HIGH)'
     A macro for a C expression which converts a double-precision
     integer found in LOW and HIGH, two variables of type INT, into a
     floating point value which is then stored into X.


Miscellaneous Parameters
========================

   Here are several miscellaneous parameters.

`PREDICATE_CODES'
     Define this if you have defined special-purpose predicates in the
     file `MACHINE.c'.  This macro is called within an initializer of an
     array of structures.  The first field in the structure is the name
     of a predicate and the second field is an array of rtl codes.  For
     each predicate, list all rtl codes that can be in expressions
     matched by the predicate.  The list should have a trailing comma.
     Here is an example of two entries in the list for a typical RISC
     machine:

          #define PREDICATE_CODES \
            {"gen_reg_rtx_operand", {SUBREG, REG}},  \
            {"reg_or_short_cint_operand", {SUBREG, REG, CONST_INT}},

     Defining this macro does not affect the generated code (however,
     incorrect definitions that omit an rtl code that may be matched by
     the predicate can cause the compiler to malfunction).  Instead, it
     allows the table built by `genrecog' to be more compact and
     efficient, thus speeding up the compiler.  The most important
     predicates to include in the list specified by this macro are
     thoses used in the most insn patterns.

`CASE_VECTOR_MODE'
     An alias for a machine mode name.  This is the machine mode that
     elements of a jump-table should have.

`CASE_VECTOR_PC_RELATIVE'
     Define this macro if jump-tables should contain relative addresses.

`CASE_DROPS_THROUGH'
     Define this if control falls through a `case' insn when the index
     value is out of range.  This means the specified default-label is
     actually ignored by the `case' insn proper.

`CASE_VALUES_THRESHOLD'
     Define this to be the smallest number of different values for
     which it is best to use a jump-table instead of a tree of
     conditional branches.  The default is four for machines with a
     `casesi' instruction and five otherwise.  This is best for most
     machines.

`WORD_REGISTER_OPERATIONS'
     Define this macro if operations between registers with integral
     mode smaller than a word are always performed on the entire
     register.  Most RISC machines have this property and most CISC
     machines do not.

`LOAD_EXTEND_OP (MODE)'
     Define this macro to be a C expression indicating when insns that
     read memory in MODE, an integral mode narrower than a word, set the
     bits outside of MODE to be either the sign-extension or the
     zero-extension of the data read.  Return `SIGN_EXTEND' for values
     of MODE for which the insn sign-extends, `ZERO_EXTEND' for which
     it zero-extends, and `NIL' for other modes.

     This macro is not called with MODE non-integral or with a width
     greater than or equal to `BITS_PER_WORD', so you may return any
     value in this case.  Do not define this macro if it would always
     return `NIL'.  On machines where this macro is defined, you will
     normally define it as the constant `SIGN_EXTEND' or `ZERO_EXTEND'.

`IMPLICIT_FIX_EXPR'
     An alias for a tree code that should be used by default for
     conversion of floating point values to fixed point.  Normally,
     `FIX_ROUND_EXPR' is used.

`FIXUNS_TRUNC_LIKE_FIX_TRUNC'
     Define this macro if the same instructions that convert a floating
     point number to a signed fixed point number also convert validly
     to an unsigned one.

`EASY_DIV_EXPR'
     An alias for a tree code that is the easiest kind of division to
     compile code for in the general case.  It may be `TRUNC_DIV_EXPR',
     `FLOOR_DIV_EXPR', `CEIL_DIV_EXPR' or `ROUND_DIV_EXPR'.  These four
     division operators differ in how they round the result to an
     integer.  `EASY_DIV_EXPR' is used when it is permissible to use
     any of those kinds of division and the choice should be made on
     the basis of efficiency.

`MOVE_MAX'
     The maximum number of bytes that a single instruction can move
     quickly from memory to memory.

`MAX_MOVE_MAX'
     The maximum number of bytes that a single instruction can move
     quickly from memory to memory.  If this is undefined, the default
     is `MOVE_MAX'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
     largest value that `MOVE_MAX' can have at run-time.

`SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED'
     A C expression that is nonzero if on this machine the number of
     bits actually used for the count of a shift operation is equal to
     the number of bits needed to represent the size of the object
     being shifted.  When this macro is non-zero, the compiler will
     assume that it is safe to omit a sign-extend, zero-extend, and
     certain bitwise `and' instructions that truncates the count of a
     shift operation.  On machines that have instructions that act on
     bitfields at variable positions, which may include `bit test'
     instructions, a nonzero `SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED' also enables
     deletion of truncations of the values that serve as arguments to
     bitfield instructions.

     If both types of instructions truncate the count (for shifts) and
     position (for bitfield operations), or if no variable-position
     bitfield instructions exist, you should define this macro.

     However, on some machines, such as the 80386 and the 680x0,
     truncation only applies to shift operations and not the (real or
     pretended) bitfield operations.  Define `SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED' to
     be zero on such machines.  Instead, add patterns to the `md' file
     that include the implied truncation of the shift instructions.

     You need not define this macro if it would always have the value
     of zero.

`TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION (OUTPREC, INPREC)'
     A C expression which is nonzero if on this machine it is safe to
     "convert" an integer of INPREC bits to one of OUTPREC bits (where
     OUTPREC is smaller than INPREC) by merely operating on it as if it
     had only OUTPREC bits.

     On many machines, this expression can be 1.

     When `TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION' returns 1 for a pair of sizes for
     modes for which `MODES_TIEABLE_P' is 0, suboptimal code can result.
     If this is the case, making `TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION' return 0 in
     such cases may improve things.

`STORE_FLAG_VALUE'
     A C expression describing the value returned by a comparison
     operator with an integral mode and stored by a store-flag
     instruction (`sCOND') when the condition is true.  This
     description must apply to *all* the `sCOND' patterns and all the
     comparison operators whose results have a `MODE_INT' mode.

     A value of 1 or -1 means that the instruction implementing the
     comparison operator returns exactly 1 or -1 when the comparison is
     true and 0 when the comparison is false.  Otherwise, the value
     indicates which bits of the result are guaranteed to be 1 when the
     comparison is true.  This value is interpreted in the mode of the
     comparison operation, which is given by the mode of the first
     operand in the `sCOND' pattern.  Either the low bit or the sign
     bit of `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' be on.  Presently, only those bits are
     used by the compiler.

     If `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is neither 1 or -1, the compiler will
     generate code that depends only on the specified bits.  It can also
     replace comparison operators with equivalent operations if they
     cause the required bits to be set, even if the remaining bits are
     undefined.  For example, on a machine whose comparison operators
     return an `SImode' value and where `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is defined as
     `0x80000000', saying that just the sign bit is relevant, the
     expression

          (ne:SI (and:SI X (const_int POWER-OF-2)) (const_int 0))

     can be converted to

          (ashift:SI X (const_int N))

     where N is the appropriate shift count to move the bit being
     tested into the sign bit.

     There is no way to describe a machine that always sets the
     low-order bit for a true value, but does not guarantee the value
     of any other bits, but we do not know of any machine that has such
     an instruction.  If you are trying to port GNU CC to such a
     machine, include an instruction to perform a logical-and of the
     result with 1 in the pattern for the comparison operators and let
     us know (*note How to Report Bugs: Bug Reporting.).

     Often, a machine will have multiple instructions that obtain a
     value from a comparison (or the condition codes).  Here are rules
     to guide the choice of value for `STORE_FLAG_VALUE', and hence the
     instructions to be used:

        * Use the shortest sequence that yields a valid definition for
          `STORE_FLAG_VALUE'.  It is more efficient for the compiler to
          "normalize" the value (convert it to, e.g., 1 or 0) than for
          the comparison operators to do so because there may be
          opportunities to combine the normalization with other
          operations.

        * For equal-length sequences, use a value of 1 or -1, with -1
          being slightly preferred on machines with expensive jumps and
          1 preferred on other machines.

        * As a second choice, choose a value of `0x80000001' if
          instructions exist that set both the sign and low-order bits
          but do not define the others.

        * Otherwise, use a value of `0x80000000'.

     Many machines can produce both the value chosen for
     `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' and its negation in the same number of
     instructions.  On those machines, you should also define a pattern
     for those cases, e.g., one matching

          (set A (neg:M (ne:M B C)))

     Some machines can also perform `and' or `plus' operations on
     condition code values with less instructions than the corresponding
     `sCOND' insn followed by `and' or `plus'.  On those machines,
     define the appropriate patterns.  Use the names `incscc' and
     `decscc', respectively, for the the patterns which perform `plus'
     or `minus' operations on condition code values.  See `rs6000.md'
     for some examples.  The GNU Superoptizer can be used to find such
     instruction sequences on other machines.

     You need not define `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' if the machine has no
     store-flag instructions.

`FLOAT_STORE_FLAG_VALUE'
     A C expression that gives a non-zero floating point value that is
     returned when comparison operators with floating-point results are
     true.  Define this macro on machine that have comparison
     operations that return floating-point values.  If there are no
     such operations, do not define this macro.

`Pmode'
     An alias for the machine mode for pointers.  Normally the
     definition can be

          #define Pmode SImode

`FUNCTION_MODE'
     An alias for the machine mode used for memory references to
     functions being called, in `call' RTL expressions.  On most
     machines this should be `QImode'.

`INTEGRATE_THRESHOLD (DECL)'
     A C expression for the maximum number of instructions above which
     the function DECL should not be inlined.  DECL is a
     `FUNCTION_DECL' node.

     The default definition of this macro is 64 plus 8 times the number
     of arguments that the function accepts.  Some people think a larger
     threshold should be used on RISC machines.

`SCCS_DIRECTIVE'
     Define this if the preprocessor should ignore `#sccs' directives
     and print no error message.

`NO_IMPLICIT_EXTERN_C'
     Define this macro if the system header files support C++ as well
     as C.  This macro inhibits the usual method of using system header
     files in C++, which is to pretend that the file's contents are
     enclosed in `extern "C" {...}'.

`HANDLE_PRAGMA (STREAM)'
     Define this macro if you want to implement any pragmas.  If
     defined, it should be a C statement to be executed when `#pragma'
     is seen.  The argument STREAM is the stdio input stream from which
     the source text can be read.

     It is generally a bad idea to implement new uses of `#pragma'.  The
     only reason to define this macro is for compatibility with other
     compilers that do support `#pragma' for the sake of any user
     programs which already use it.

`VALID_MACHINE_ATTRIBUTE (TYPE, ATTRIBUTES, IDENTIFIER)'
     Define this macro if you want to support machine specific
     attributes for types.  If defined, it should be a C statement
     whose value is nonzero if IDENTIFIER is an attribute that is valid
     for TYPE.  The attributes in ATTRIBUTES have previously been
     assigned to TYPE.

`COMP_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (TYPE1, TYPE2)'
     Define this macro if type attributes must be checked for
     compatibility.  If defined, it should be a C statement that
     returns zero if the attributes on TYPE1 and TYPE2 are
     incompatible, one if they are compatible, and two if they are
     nearly compatible (which causes a warning to be generated).

`SET_DEFAULT_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (TYPE)'
     Define this macro if you want to give the newly defined TYPE some
     default attributes.

`DOLLARS_IN_IDENTIFIERS'
     Define this macro to control use of the character `$' in identifier
     names.  The value should be 0, 1, or 2.  0 means `$' is not allowed
     by default; 1 means it is allowed by default if `-traditional' is
     used; 2 means it is allowed by default provided `-ansi' is not
     used.  1 is the default; there is no need to define this macro in
     that case.

`NO_DOLLAR_IN_LABEL'
     Define this macro if the assembler does not accept the character
     `$' in label names.  By default constructors and destructors in
     G++ have `$' in the identifiers.  If this macro is defined, `.' is
     used instead.

`NO_DOT_IN_LABEL'
     Define this macro if the assembler does not accept the character
     `.' in label names.  By default constructors and destructors in G++
     have names that use `.'.  If this macro is defined, these names
     are rewritten to avoid `.'.

`DEFAULT_MAIN_RETURN'
     Define this macro if the target system expects every program's
     `main' function to return a standard "success" value by default
     (if no other value is explicitly returned).

     The definition should be a C statement (sans semicolon) to
     generate the appropriate rtl instructions.  It is used only when
     compiling the end of `main'.

`HAVE_ATEXIT'
     Define this if the target system supports the function `atexit'
     from the ANSI C standard.  If this is not defined, and
     `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP' is not defined, a default `exit' function
     will be provided to support C++.

`EXIT_BODY'
     Define this if your `exit' function needs to do something besides
     calling an external function `_cleanup' before terminating with
     `_exit'.  The `EXIT_BODY' macro is only needed if netiher
     `HAVE_ATEXIT' nor `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP' are defined.

`INSN_SETS_ARE_DELAYED (INSN)'
     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if it is safe
     for the delay slot scheduler to place instructions in the delay
     slot of INSN, even if they appear to use a resource set or
     clobbered in INSN.  INSN is always a `jump_insn' or an `insn'; GNU
     CC knows that every `call_insn' has this behavior.  On machines
     where some `insn' or `jump_insn' is really a function call and
     hence has this behavior, you should define this macro.

     You need not define this macro if it would always return zero.

`INSN_REFERENCES_ARE_DELAYED (INSN)'
     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if it is safe
     for the delay slot scheduler to place instructions in the delay
     slot of INSN, even if they appear to set or clobber a resource
     referenced in INSN.  INSN is always a `jump_insn' or an `insn'.
     On machines where some `insn' or `jump_insn' is really a function
     call and its operands are registers whose use is actually in the
     subroutine it calls, you should define this macro.  Doing so
     allows the delay slot scheduler to move instructions which copy
     arguments into the argument registers into the delay slot of INSN.

     You need not define this macro if it would always return zero.

`MACHINE_DEPENDENT_REORG (INSN)'
     In rare cases, correct code generation requires extra machine
     dependent processing between the second jump optimization pass and
     delayed branch scheduling.  On those machines, define this macro
     as a C statement to act on the code starting at INSN.




The Configuration File
**********************

   The configuration file `xm-MACHINE.h' contains macro definitions
that describe the machine and system on which the compiler is running,
unlike the definitions in `MACHINE.h', which describe the machine for
which the compiler is producing output.  Most of the values in
`xm-MACHINE.h' are actually the same on all machines that GNU CC runs
on, so large parts of all configuration files are identical.  But there
are some macros that vary:

`USG'
     Define this macro if the host system is System V.

`VMS'
     Define this macro if the host system is VMS.

`FAILURE_EXIT_CODE'
     A C expression for the status code to be returned when the compiler
     exits after serious errors.

`SUCCESS_EXIT_CODE'
     A C expression for the status code to be returned when the compiler
     exits without serious errors.

`HOST_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'
     Defined if the host machine stores words of multi-word values in
     big-endian order.  (GNU CC does not depend on the host byte
     ordering within a word.)

`HOST_FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'
     Define this macro to be 1 if the host machine stores `DFmode',
     `XFmode' or `TFmode' floating point numbers in memory with the
     word containing the sign bit at the lowest address; otherwise,
     define it to be zero.

     This macro need not be defined if the ordering is the same as for
     multi-word integers.

`HOST_FLOAT_FORMAT'
     A numeric code distinguishing the floating point format for the
     host machine.  See `TARGET_FLOAT_FORMAT' in *Note Storage Layout::
     for the alternatives and default.

`HOST_BITS_PER_CHAR'
     A C expression for the number of bits in `char' on the host
     machine.

`HOST_BITS_PER_SHORT'
     A C expression for the number of bits in `short' on the host
     machine.

`HOST_BITS_PER_INT'
     A C expression for the number of bits in `int' on the host machine.

`HOST_BITS_PER_LONG'
     A C expression for the number of bits in `long' on the host
     machine.

`ONLY_INT_FIELDS'
     Define this macro to indicate that the host compiler only supports
     `int' bit fields, rather than other integral types, including
     `enum', as do most C compilers.

`EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX'
     Define this macro if the host system uses a naming convention for
     executable files that involves a common suffix (such as, in some
     systems, `.exe') that must be mentioned explicitly when you run
     the program.

`OBSTACK_CHUNK_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size of ordinary obstack chunks.  If you
     don't define this, a usually-reasonable default is used.

`OBSTACK_CHUNK_ALLOC'
     The function used to allocate obstack chunks.  If you don't define
     this, `xmalloc' is used.

`OBSTACK_CHUNK_FREE'
     The function used to free obstack chunks.  If you don't define
     this, `free' is used.

`USE_C_ALLOCA'
     Define this macro to indicate that the compiler is running with the
     `alloca' implemented in C.  This version of `alloca' can be found
     in the file `alloca.c'; to use it, you must also alter the
     `Makefile' variable `ALLOCA'.  (This is done automatically for the
     systems on which we know it is needed.)

     If you do define this macro, you should probably do it as follows:

          #ifndef __GNUC__
          #define USE_C_ALLOCA
          #else
          #define alloca __builtin_alloca
          #endif

     so that when the compiler is compiled with GNU CC it uses the more
     efficient built-in `alloca' function.

`FUNCTION_CONVERSION_BUG'
     Define this macro to indicate that the host compiler does not
     properly handle converting a function value to a
     pointer-to-function when it is used in an expression.

`HAVE_VPRINTF'
     Define this if the library function `vprintf' is available on your
     system.

`MULTIBYTE_CHARS'
     Define this macro to enable support for multibyte characters in the
     input to GNU CC.  This requires that the host system support the
     ANSI C library functions for converting multibyte characters to
     wide characters.

`HAVE_PUTENV'
     Define this if the library function `putenv' is available on your
     system.

`NO_SYS_SIGLIST'
     Define this if your system *does not* provide the variable
     `sys_siglist'.

`DONT_DECLARE_SYS_SIGLIST'
     Define this if your system has the variable `sys_siglist', and
     there is already a declaration of it in the system header files.

`USE_PROTOTYPES'
     Define this to be 1 if you know that the host compiler supports
     prototypes, even if it doesn't define __STDC__, or define it to be
     0 if you do not want any prototypes used in compiling GNU CC.  If
     `USE_PROTOTYPES' is not defined, it will be determined
     automatically whether your compiler supports prototypes by
     checking if `__STDC__' is defined.

`NO_MD_PROTOTYPES'
     Define this if you wish suppression of prototypes generated from
     the machine description file, but to use other prototypes within
     GNU CC.  If `USE_PROTOTYPES' is defined to be 0, or the host
     compiler does not support prototypes, this macro has no effect.

`MD_CALL_PROTOTYPES'
     Define this if you wish to generate prototypes for the `gen_call'
     or `gen_call_value' functions generated from the machine
     description file.  If `USE_PROTOTYPES' is defined to be 0, or the
     host compiler does not support prototypes, or `NO_MD_PROTOTYPES'
     is defined, this macro has no effect.  As soon as all of the
     machine descriptions are modified to have the appropriate number
     of arguments, this macro will be removed.

     Some systems do provide this variable, but with a different name
     such as `_sys_siglist'.  On these systems, you can define
     `sys_siglist' as a macro which expands into the name actually
     provided.

`NO_STAB_H'
     Define this if your system does not have the include file
     `stab.h'.  If `USG' is defined, `NO_STAB_H' is assumed.

`PATH_SEPARATOR'
     Define this macro to be a C character constant representing the
     character used to separate components in paths.  The default value
     is.  the colon character

`DIR_SEPARATOR'
     If your system uses some character other than slash to separate
     directory names within a file specification, define this macro to
     be a C character constant specifying that character.  When GNU CC
     displays file names, the character you specify will be used.  GNU
     CC will test for both slash and the character you specify when
     parsing filenames.

   In addition, configuration files for system V define `bcopy',
`bzero' and `bcmp' as aliases.  Some files define `alloca' as a macro
when compiled with GNU CC, in order to take advantage of the benefit of
GNU CC's built-in `alloca'.

Options for Debugging Your Program or GNU CC
============================================

   GNU CC has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or GCC:

`-g'
     Produce debugging information in the operating system's native
     format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF).  GDB can work with this
     debugging information.

     On most systems that use stabs format, `-g' enables use of extra
     debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information
     makes debugging work better in GDB but will probably make other
     debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.  If you want to
     control for certain whether to generate the extra information, use
     `-gstabs+', `-gstabs', `-gxcoff+', `-gxcoff', `-gdwarf+', or
     `-gdwarf' (see below).

     Unlike most other C compilers, GNU CC allows you to use `-g' with
     `-O'.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
     produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not
     exist at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not
     expect it; some statements may not be executed because they
     compute constant results or their values were already at hand;
     some statements may execute in different places because they were
     moved out of loops.

     Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This
     makes it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might
     have bugs.

     The following options are useful when GNU CC is generated with the
     capability for more than one debugging format.

`-ggdb'
     Produce debugging information in the native format (if that is
     supported), including GDB extensions if at all possible.

`-gstabs'
     Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
     supported), without GDB extensions.  This is the format used by
     DBX on most BSD systems.  On MIPS, Alpha and System V Release 4
     systems this option produces stabs debugging output which is not
     understood by DBX or SDB.  On System V Release 4 systems this
     option requires the GNU assembler.

`-gstabs+'
     Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
     supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
     debugger (GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to make
     other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.

`-gcoff'
     Produce debugging information in COFF format (if that is
     supported).  This is the format used by SDB on most System V
     systems prior to System V Release 4.

`-gxcoff'
     Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is
     supported).  This is the format used by the DBX debugger on IBM
     RS/6000 systems.

`-gxcoff+'
     Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is
     supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
     debugger (GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to make
     other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.

`-gdwarf'
     Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is
     supported).  This is the format used by SDB on most System V
     Release 4 systems.

`-gdwarf+'
     Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is
     supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
     debugger (GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to make
     other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.

`-gLEVEL'
`-ggdbLEVEL'
`-gstabsLEVEL'
`-gcoffLEVEL'
`-gxcoffLEVEL'
`-gdwarfLEVEL'
     Request debugging information and also use LEVEL to specify how
     much information.  The default level is 2.

     Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces
     in parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This
     includes descriptions of functions and external variables, but no
     information about local variables and no line numbers.

     Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro
     definitions present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro
     expansion when you use `-g3'.

`-p'
     Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
     analysis program `prof'.  You must use this option when compiling
     the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
     linking.

`-pg'
     Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
     analysis program `gprof'.  You must use this option when compiling
     the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
     linking.

`-a'
     Generate extra code to write profile information for basic blocks,
     which will record the number of times each basic block is
     executed, the basic block start address, and the function name
     containing the basic block.  If `-g' is used, the line number and
     filename of the start of the basic block will also be recorded.
     If not overridden by the machine description, the default action is
     to append to the text file `bb.out'.

     This data could be analyzed by a program like `tcov'.  Note,
     however, that the format of the data is not what `tcov' expects.
     Eventually GNU `gprof' should be extended to process this data.

`-dLETTERS'
     Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified
     by LETTERS.  This is used for debugging the compiler.  The file
     names for most of the dumps are made by appending a word to the
     source file name (e.g.  `foo.c.rtl' or `foo.c.jump').  Here are the
     possible letters for use in LETTERS, and their meanings:

    `M'
          Dump all macro definitions, at the end of preprocessing, and
          write no output.

    `N'
          Dump all macro names, at the end of preprocessing.

    `D'
          Dump all macro definitions, at the end of preprocessing, in
          addition to normal output.

    `y'
          Dump debugging information during parsing, to standard error.

    `r'
          Dump after RTL generation, to `FILE.rtl'.

    `x'
          Just generate RTL for a function instead of compiling it.
          Usually used with `r'.

    `j'
          Dump after first jump optimization, to `FILE.jump'.

    `s'
          Dump after CSE (including the jump optimization that sometimes
          follows CSE), to `FILE.cse'.

    `L'
          Dump after loop optimization, to `FILE.loop'.

    `t'
          Dump after the second CSE pass (including the jump
          optimization that sometimes follows CSE), to `FILE.cse2'.

    `f'
          Dump after flow analysis, to `FILE.flow'.

    `c'
          Dump after instruction combination, to the file
          `FILE.combine'.

    `S'
          Dump after the first instruction scheduling pass, to
          `FILE.sched'.

    `l'
          Dump after local register allocation, to `FILE.lreg'.

    `g'
          Dump after global register allocation, to `FILE.greg'.

    `R'
          Dump after the second instruction scheduling pass, to
          `FILE.sched2'.

    `J'
          Dump after last jump optimization, to `FILE.jump2'.

    `d'
          Dump after delayed branch scheduling, to `FILE.dbr'.

    `k'
          Dump after conversion from registers to stack, to
          `FILE.stack'.

    `a'
          Produce all the dumps listed above.

    `m'
          Print statistics on memory usage, at the end of the run, to
          standard error.

    `p'
          Annotate the assembler output with a comment indicating which
          pattern and alternative was used.

`-fpretend-float'
     When running a cross-compiler, pretend that the target machine
     uses the same floating point format as the host machine.  This
     causes incorrect output of the actual floating constants, but the
     actual instruction sequence will probably be the same as GNU CC
     would make when running on the target machine.

`-save-temps'
     Store the usual "temporary" intermediate files permanently; place
     them in the current directory and name them based on the source
     file.  Thus, compiling `foo.c' with `-c -save-temps' would produce
     files `foo.i' and `foo.s', as well as `foo.o'.

`-print-file-name=LIBRARY'
     Print the full absolute name of the library file LIBRARY that
     would be used when linking--and don't do anything else.  With this
     option, GNU CC does not compile or link anything; it just prints
     the file name.

`-print-prog-name=PROGRAM'
     Like `-print-file-name', but searches for a program such as `cpp'.

`-print-libgcc-file-name'
     Same as `-print-file-name=libgcc.a'.

     This is useful when you use `-nostdlib' but you do want to link
     with `libgcc.a'.  You can do

          gcc -nostdlib FILES... `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`




Options That Control Optimization
=================================

   These options control various sorts of optimizations:

`-O'
`-O1'
     Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a
     lot more memory for a large function.

     Without `-O', the compiler's goal is to reduce the cost of
     compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results.
     Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
     breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to
     any variable or change the program counter to any other statement
     in the function and get exactly the results you would expect from
     the source code.

     Without `-O', the compiler only allocates variables declared
     `register' in registers.  The resulting compiled code is a little
     worse than produced by PCC without `-O'.

     With `-O', the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
     time.

     When you specify `-O', the compiler turns on `-fthread-jumps' and
     `-fdefer-pop' on all machines.  The compiler turns on
     `-fdelayed-branch' on machines that have delay slots, and
     `-fomit-frame-pointer' on machines that can support debugging even
     without a frame pointer.  On some machines the compiler also turns
     on other flags.

`-O2'
     Optimize even more.  GNU CC performs nearly all supported
     optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  The
     compiler does not perform loop unrolling or function inlining when
     you specify `-O2'.  As compared to `-O', this option increases
     both compilation time and the performance of the generated code.

     `-O2' turns on all optional optimizations except for loop unrolling
     and function inlining.  It also turns on frame pointer elimination
     on machines where doing so does not interfer with debugging.

`-O3'
     Optimize yet more.  `-O3' turns on all optimizations specified by
     `-O2' and also turns on the `inline-functions' option.

`-O0'
     Do not optimize.

     If you use multiple `-O' options, with or without level numbers,
     the last such option is the one that is effective.

   Options of the form `-fFLAG' specify machine-independent flags.
Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
`-ffoo' would be `-fno-foo'.  In the table below, only one of the forms
is listed--the one which is not the default.  You can figure out the
other form by either removing `no-' or adding it.

`-ffloat-store'
     Do not store floating point variables in registers, and inhibit
     other options that might change whether a floating point value is
     taken from a register or memory.

     This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such
     as the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
     precision than a `double' is supposed to have.  For most programs,
     the excess precision does only good, but a few programs rely on the
     precise definition of IEEE floating point.  Use `-ffloat-store' for
     such programs.

`-fno-default-inline'
     Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they
     are defined inside the class scope (C++ only).  Otherwise, when
     you specify `-O', member functions defined inside class scope are
     compiled inline by default; i.e., you don't need to add `inline'
     in front of the member function name.

`-fno-defer-pop'
     Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that
     function returns.  For machines which must pop arguments after a
     function call, the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on
     the stack for several function calls and pops them all at once.

`-fforce-mem'
     Force memory operands to be copied into registers before doing
     arithmetic on them.  This may produce better code by making all
     memory references potential common subexpressions.  When they are
     not common subexpressions, instruction combination should
     eliminate the separate register-load.  I am interested in hearing
     about the difference this makes.

`-fforce-addr'
     Force memory address constants to be copied into registers before
     doing arithmetic on them.  This may produce better code just as
     `-fforce-mem' may.  I am interested in hearing about the
     difference this makes.

`-fomit-frame-pointer'
     Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
     don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
     restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
     in many functions.  *It also makes debugging impossible on some
     machines.*

     On some machines, such as the Vax, this flag has no effect, because
     the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame
     pointer and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
     machine-description macro `FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED' controls
     whether a target machine supports this flag.  *Note Registers::.

`-fno-inline'
     Don't pay attention to the `inline' keyword.  Normally this option
     is used to keep the compiler from expanding any functions inline.
     Note that if you are not optimizing, no functions can be expanded
     inline.

`-finline-functions'
     Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler
     heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
     integrating in this way.

     If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function
     is declared `static', then the function is normally not output as
     assembler code in its own right.

`-fkeep-inline-functions'
     Even if all calls to a given function are integrated, and the
     function is declared `static', nevertheless output a separate
     run-time callable version of the function.

`-fno-function-cse'
     Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction
     that calls a constant function contain the function's address
     explicitly.

     This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
     that alter the assembler output may be confused by the
     optimizations performed when this option is not used.

`-ffast-math'
     This option allows GCC to violate some ANSI or IEEE rules and/or
     specifications in the interest of optimizing code for speed.  For
     example, it allows the compiler to assume arguments to the `sqrt'
     function are non-negative numbers and that no floating-point values
     are NaNs.

     This option should never be turned on by any `-O' option since it
     can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on an
     exact implementation of IEEE or ANSI rules/specifications for math
     functions.

   The following options control specific optimizations.  The `-O2'
option turns on all of these optimizations except `-funroll-loops' and
`-funroll-all-loops'.  On most machines, the `-O' option turns on the
`-fthread-jumps' and `-fdelayed-branch' options, but specific machines
may handle it differently.

   You can use the following flags in the rare cases when "fine-tuning"
of optimizations to be performed is desired.

`-fstrength-reduce'
     Perform the optimizations of loop strength reduction and
     elimination of iteration variables.

`-fthread-jumps'
     Perform optimizations where we check to see if a jump branches to a
     location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.
     If so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of
     the second branch or a point immediately following it, depending
     on whether the condition is known to be true or false.

`-fcse-follow-jumps'
     In common subexpression elimination, scan through jump instructions
     when the target of the jump is not reached by any other path.  For
     example, when CSE encounters an `if' statement with an `else'
     clause, CSE will follow the jump when the condition tested is
     false.

`-fcse-skip-blocks'
     This is similar to `-fcse-follow-jumps', but causes CSE to follow
     jumps which conditionally skip over blocks.  When CSE encounters a
     simple `if' statement with no else clause, `-fcse-skip-blocks'
     causes CSE to follow the jump around the body of the `if'.

`-frerun-cse-after-loop'
     Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop optimizations
     has been performed.

`-fexpensive-optimizations'
     Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively
     expensive.

`-fdelayed-branch'
     If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
     instructions to exploit instruction slots available after delayed
     branch instructions.

`-fschedule-insns'
     If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
     instructions to eliminate execution stalls due to required data
     being unavailable.  This helps machines that have slow floating
     point or memory load instructions by allowing other instructions
     to be issued until the result of the load or floating point
     instruction is required.

`-fschedule-insns2'
     Similar to `-fschedule-insns', but requests an additional pass of
     instruction scheduling after register allocation has been done.
     This is especially useful on machines with a relatively small
     number of registers and where memory load instructions take more
     than one cycle.

`-fcaller-saves'
     Enable values to be allocated in registers that will be clobbered
     by function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save and
     restore the registers around such calls.  Such allocation is done
     only when it seems to result in better code than would otherwise
     be produced.

     This option is enabled by default on certain machines, usually
     those which have no call-preserved registers to use instead.

`-funroll-loops'
     Perform the optimization of loop unrolling.  This is only done for
     loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time
     or run time.  `-funroll-loop' implies both `-fstrength-reduce' and
     `-frerun-cse-after-loop'.

`-funroll-all-loops'
     Perform the optimization of loop unrolling.  This is done for all
     loops and usually makes programs run more slowly.
     `-funroll-all-loops' implies `-fstrength-reduce' as well as
     `-frerun-cse-after-loop'.

`-fno-peephole'
     Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations.




Options Controlling the Preprocessor
====================================

   These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C
source file before actual compilation.

   If you use the `-E' option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
Some of these options make sense only together with `-E' because they
cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual compilation.

`-include FILE'
     Process FILE as input before processing the regular input file.
     In effect, the contents of FILE are compiled first.  Any `-D' and
     `-U' options on the command line are always processed before
     `-include FILE', regardless of the order in which they are
     written.  All the `-include' and `-imacros' options are processed
     in the order in which they are written.

`-imacros FILE'
     Process FILE as input, discarding the resulting output, before
     processing the regular input file.  Because the output generated
     from FILE is discarded, the only effect of `-imacros FILE' is to
     make the macros defined in FILE available for use in the main
     input.

     Any `-D' and `-U' options on the command line are always processed
     before `-imacros FILE', regardless of the order in which they are
     written.  All the `-include' and `-imacros' options are processed
     in the order in which they are written.

`-idirafter DIR'
     Add the directory DIR to the second include path.  The directories
     on the second include path are searched when a header file is not
     found in any of the directories in the main include path (the one
     that `-I' adds to).

`-iprefix PREFIX'
     Specify PREFIX as the prefix for subsequent `-iwithprefix' options.

`-iwithprefix DIR'
     Add a directory to the second include path.  The directory's name
     is made by concatenating PREFIX and DIR, where PREFIX was
     specified previously with `-iprefix'.  If you have not specified a
     prefix yet, the directory containing the installed passes of the
     compiler is used as the default.

`-iwithprefixbefore DIR'
     Add a directory to the main include path.  The directory's name is
     made by concatenating PREFIX and DIR, as in the case of
     `-iwithprefix'.

`-isystem DIR'
     Add a directory to the beginning of the second include path,
     marking it as a system directory, so that it gets the same special
     treatment as is applied to the standard system directories.

`-nostdinc'
     Do not search the standard system directories for header files.
     Only the directories you have specified with `-I' options (and the
     current directory, if appropriate) are searched.  *Note Directory
     Options::, for information on `-I'.

     By using both `-nostdinc' and `-I-', you can limit the include-file
     search path to only those directories you specify explicitly.

`-undef'
     Do not predefine any nonstandard macros.  (Including architecture
     flags).

`-E'
     Run only the C preprocessor.  Preprocess all the C source files
     specified and output the results to standard output or to the
     specified output file.

`-C'
     Tell the preprocessor not to discard comments.  Used with the `-E'
     option.

`-P'
     Tell the preprocessor not to generate `#line' commands.  Used with
     the `-E' option.

`-M'
     Tell the preprocessor to output a rule suitable for `make'
     describing the dependencies of each object file.  For each source
     file, the preprocessor outputs one `make'-rule whose target is the
     object file name for that source file and whose dependencies are
     all the `#include' header files it uses.  This rule may be a
     single line or may be continued with `\'-newline if it is long.
     The list of rules is printed on standard output instead of the
     preprocessed C program.

     `-M' implies `-E'.

     Another way to specify output of a `make' rule is by setting the
     environment variable `DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT' (*note Environment
     Variables::.).

`-MM'
     Like `-M' but the output mentions only the user header files
     included with `#include "FILE"'.  System header files included
     with `#include <FILE>' are omitted.

`-MD'
     Like `-M' but the dependency information is written to a file made
     by replacing ".c" with ".d" at the end of the input file names.
     This is in addition to compiling the file as specified--`-MD' does
     not inhibit ordinary compilation the way `-M' does.

     In Mach, you can use the utility `md' to merge multiple dependency
     files into a single dependency file suitable for using with the
     `make' command.

`-MMD'
     Like `-MD' except mention only user header files, not system
     header files.

`-MG'
     Treat missing header files as generated files and assume they live
     in the same directory as the source file.  If you specify `-MG',
     you must also specify either `-M' or `-MM'.  `-MG' is not
     supported with `-MD' or `-MMD'.

`-H'
     Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other
     normal activities.

`-AQUESTION(ANSWER)'
     Assert the answer ANSWER for QUESTION, in case it is tested with a
     preprocessor conditional such as `#if #QUESTION(ANSWER)'.  `-A-'
     disables the standard assertions that normally describe the target
     machine.

`-DMACRO'
     Define macro MACRO with the string `1' as its definition.

`-DMACRO=DEFN'
     Define macro MACRO as DEFN.  All instances of `-D' on the command
     line are processed before any `-U' options.

`-UMACRO'
     Undefine macro MACRO.  `-U' options are evaluated after all `-D'
     options, but before any `-include' and `-imacros' options.

`-dM'
     Tell the preprocessor to output only a list of the macro
     definitions that are in effect at the end of preprocessing.  Used
     with the `-E' option.

`-dD'
     Tell the preprocessing to pass all macro definitions into the
     output, in their proper sequence in the rest of the output.

`-dN'
     Like `-dD' except that the macro arguments and contents are
     omitted.  Only `#define NAME' is included in the output.

`-trigraphs'
     Support ANSI C trigraphs.  The `-ansi' option also has this effect.

`-Wp,OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the preprocessor.  If OPTION contains
     commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.




Passing Options to the Assembler
================================

   You can pass options to the assembler.

`-Wa,OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the assembler.  If OPTION contains
     commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.




Options for Linking
===================

   These options come into play when the compiler links object files
into an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.

`OBJECT-FILE-NAME'
     A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
     considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
     distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
     contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as
     input to the linker.

`-c'
`-S'
`-E'
     If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
     object file names should not be used as arguments.  *Note Overall
     Options::.

`-lLIBRARY'
     Search the library named LIBRARY when linking.

     It makes a difference where in the command you write this option;
     the linker searches processes libraries and object files in the
     order they are specified.  Thus, `foo.o -lz bar.o' searches
     library `z' after file `foo.o' but before `bar.o'.  If `bar.o'
     refers to functions in `z', those functions may not be loaded.

     The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
     which is actually a file named `libLIBRARY.a'.  The linker then
     uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.

     The directories searched include several standard system
     directories plus any that you specify with `-L'.

     Normally the files found this way are library files--archive files
     whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive
     file by scanning through it for members which define symbols that
     have so far been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that
     is found is an ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual
     fashion.  The only difference between using an `-l' option and
     specifying a file name is that `-l' surrounds LIBRARY with `lib'
     and `.a' and searches several directories.

`-lobjc'
     You need this special case of the `-l' option in order to link an
     Objective C program.

`-nostartfiles'
     Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.  The
     standard libraries are used normally.

`-nostdlib'
     Do not use the standard system libraries and startup files when
     linking.  Only the files you specify will be passed to the linker.

     One of the standard libraries bypassed by `-nostdlib' is
     `libgcc.a', a library of internal subroutines that GNU CC uses to
     overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special needs for
     some languages.  (*Note Interfacing to GNU CC Output: Interface,
     for more discussion of `libgcc.a'.) In most cases, you need
     `libgcc.a' even when you want to avoid other standard libraries.
     In other words, when you specify `-nostdlib' you should usually
     specify `-lgcc' as well.  This ensures that you have no unresolved
     references to internal GNU CC library subroutines.  (For example,
     `__main', used to ensure C++ constructors will be called; *note
     `collect2': Collect2..)

`-s'
     Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the
     executable.

`-static'
     On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking
     with the shared libraries.  On other systems, this option has no
     effect.

`-shared'
     Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other
     objects to form an executable.  Only a few systems support this
     option.

`-symbolic'
     Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.
     Warn about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the
     link editor option `-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs').  Only a few
     systems support this option.

`-Xlinker OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
     supply system-specific linker options which GNU CC does not know
     how to recognize.

     If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
     `-Xlinker' twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
     For example, to pass `-assert definitions', you must write
     `-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions'.  It does not work to write
     `-Xlinker "-assert definitions"', because this passes the entire
     string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.

`-Wl,OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the linker.  If OPTION contains
     commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.

`-u SYMBOL'
     Pretend the symbol SYMBOL is undefined, to force linking of
     library modules to define it.  You can use `-u' multiple times with
     different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.




Options for Directory Search
============================

   These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:

`-IDIR'
     Append directory DIR to the list of directories searched for
     include files.

`-I-'
     Any directories you specify with `-I' options before the `-I-'
     option are searched only for the case of `#include "FILE"'; they
     are not searched for `#include <FILE>'.

     If additional directories are specified with `-I' options after
     the `-I-', these directories are searched for all `#include'
     directives.  (Ordinarily *all* `-I' directories are used this way.)

     In addition, the `-I-' option inhibits the use of the current
     directory (where the current input file came from) as the first
     search directory for `#include "FILE"'.  There is no way to
     override this effect of `-I-'.  With `-I.' you can specify
     searching the directory which was current when the compiler was
     invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor
     does by default, but it is often satisfactory.

     `-I-' does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
     for header files.  Thus, `-I-' and `-nostdinc' are independent.

`-LDIR'
     Add directory DIR to the list of directories to be searched for
     `-l'.

`-BPREFIX'
     This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
     include files, and data files of the compiler itself.

     The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
     `cpp', `cc1', `as' and `ld'.  It tries PREFIX as a prefix for each
     program it tries to run, both with and without `MACHINE/VERSION/'
     (*note Target Options::.).

     For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
     `-B' prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if `-B' was
     not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, which are
     `/usr/lib/gcc/' and `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/'.  If neither of
     those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
     name is searched for using the directories specified in your
     `PATH' environment variable.

     `-B' prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
     to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
     options into `-L' options for the linker.  They also apply to
     includes files in the preprocessor, because the compiler
     translates these options into `-isystem' options for the
     preprocessor.  In this case, the compiler appends `include' to the
     prefix.

     The run-time support file `libgcc.a' can also be searched for using
     the `-B' prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
     standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is
     left out of the link if it is not found by those means.

     Another way to specify a prefix much like the `-B' prefix is to use
     the environment variable `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'.  *Note Environment
     Variables::.




Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version
==============================================

   By default, GNU CC compiles code for the same type of machine that
you are using.  However, it can also be installed as a cross-compiler,
to compile for some other type of machine.  In fact, several different
configurations of GNU CC, for different target machines, can be
installed side by side.  Then you specify which one to use with the
`-b' option.

   In addition, older and newer versions of GNU CC can be installed side
by side.  One of them (probably the newest) will be the default, but
you may sometimes wish to use another.

`-b MACHINE'
     The argument MACHINE specifies the target machine for compilation.
     This is useful when you have installed GNU CC as a cross-compiler.

     The value to use for MACHINE is the same as was specified as the
     machine type when configuring GNU CC as a cross-compiler.  For
     example, if a cross-compiler was configured with `configure
     i386v', meaning to compile for an 80386 running System V, then you
     would specify `-b i386v' to run that cross compiler.

     When you do not specify `-b', it normally means to compile for the
     same type of machine that you are using.

`-V VERSION'
     The argument VERSION specifies which version of GNU CC to run.
     This is useful when multiple versions are installed.  For example,
     VERSION might be `2.0', meaning to run GNU CC version 2.0.

     The default version, when you do not specify `-V', is controlled
     by the way GNU CC is installed.  Normally, it will be a version
     that is recommended for general use.

   The `-b' and `-V' options actually work by controlling part of the
file name used for the executable files and libraries used for
compilation.  A given version of GNU CC, for a given target machine, is
normally kept in the directory `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/MACHINE/VERSION'.

   Thus, sites can customize the effect of `-b' or `-V' either by
changing the names of these directories or adding alternate names (or
symbolic links).  If in directory `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/' the file
`80386' is a link to the file `i386v', then `-b 80386' becomes an alias
for `-b i386v'.

   In one respect, the `-b' or `-V' do not completely change to a
different compiler: the top-level driver program `gcc' that you
originally invoked continues to run and invoke the other executables
(preprocessor, compiler per se, assembler and linker) that do the real
work.  However, since no real work is done in the driver program, it
usually does not matter that the driver program in use is not the one
for the specified target and version.

   The only way that the driver program depends on the target machine is
in the parsing and handling of special machine-specific options.
However, this is controlled by a file which is found, along with the
other executables, in the directory for the specified version and
target machine.  As a result, a single installed driver program adapts
to any specified target machine and compiler version.

   The driver program executable does control one significant thing,
however: the default version and target machine.  Therefore, you can
install different instances of the driver program, compiled for
different targets or versions, under different names.

   For example, if the driver for version 2.0 is installed as `ogcc'
and that for version 2.1 is installed as `gcc', then the command `gcc'
will use version 2.1 by default, while `ogcc' will use 2.0 by default.
However, you can choose either version with either command with the
`-V' option.




Hardware Models and Configurations
==================================

   Earlier we discussed the standard option `-b' which chooses among
different installed compilers for completely different target machines,
such as Vax vs. 68000 vs. 80386.

   In addition, each of these target machine types can have its own
special options, starting with `-m', to choose among various hardware
models or configurations--for example, 68010 vs 68020, floating
coprocessor or none.  A single installed version of the compiler can
compile for any model or configuration, according to the options
specified.

   Some configurations of the compiler also support additional special
options, usually for compatibility with other compilers on the same
platform.

   These options are defined by the macro `TARGET_SWITCHES' in the
machine description.  The default for the options is also defined by
that macro, which enables you to change the defaults.


M680x0 Options
--------------

   These are the `-m' options defined for the 68000 series.  The default
values for these options depends on which style of 68000 was selected
when the compiler was configured; the defaults for the most common
choices are given below.

`-m68000'
`-mc68000'
     Generate output for a 68000.  This is the default when the
     compiler is configured for 68000-based systems.

`-m68020'
`-mc68020'
     Generate output for a 68020.  This is the default when the
     compiler is configured for 68020-based systems.

`-m68881'
     Generate output containing 68881 instructions for floating point.
     This is the default for most 68020 systems unless `-nfp' was
     specified when the compiler was configured.

`-m68030'
     Generate output for a 68030.  This is the default when the
     compiler is configured for 68030-based systems.

`-m68040'
     Generate output for a 68040.  This is the default when the
     compiler is configured for 68040-based systems.

     This option inhibits the use of 68881/68882 instructions that have
     to be emulated by software on the 68040.  If your 68040 does not
     have code to emulate those instructions, use `-m68040'.

`-m68020-40'
     Generate output for a 68040, without using any of the new
     instructions.  This results in code which can run relatively
     efficiently on either a 68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.  The
     generated code does use the 68881 instructions that are emulated
     on the 68040.

`-mfpa'
     Generate output containing Sun FPA instructions for floating point.

`-msoft-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not part of GNU CC.
     Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
     used, but this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You
     must make your own arrangements to provide suitable library
     functions for cross-compilation.

`-mshort'
     Consider type `int' to be 16 bits wide, like `short int'.

`-mnobitfield'
     Do not use the bit-field instructions.  The `-m68000' option
     implies `-mnobitfield'.

`-mbitfield'
     Do use the bit-field instructions.  The `-m68020' option implies
     `-mbitfield'.  This is the default if you use a configuration
     designed for a 68020.

`-mrtd'
     Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions
     that take a fixed number of arguments return with the `rtd'
     instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This
     saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop
     the arguments there.

     This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally used
     on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
     compiled with the Unix compiler.

     Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
     take variable numbers of arguments (including `printf'); otherwise
     incorrect code will be generated for calls to those functions.

     In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a
     function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
     harmlessly ignored.)

     The `rtd' instruction is supported by the 68010 and 68020
     processors, but not by the 68000.




VAX Options
-----------

   These `-m' options are defined for the Vax:

`-munix'
     Do not output certain jump instructions (`aobleq' and so on) that
     the Unix assembler for the Vax cannot handle across long ranges.

`-mgnu'
     Do output those jump instructions, on the assumption that you will
     assemble with the GNU assembler.

`-mg'
     Output code for g-format floating point numbers instead of
     d-format.




SPARC Options
-------------

   These `-m' switches are supported on the SPARC:

`-mno-app-regs'
`-mapp-regs'
     Specify `-mapp-regs' to generate output using the global registers
     2 through 4, which the SPARC SVR4 ABI reserves for applications.
     This is the default.

     To be fully SVR4 ABI compliant at the cost of some performance
     loss, specify `-mno-app-regs'.  You should compile libraries and
     system software with this option.

`-mfpu'
`-mhard-float'
     Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is
     the default.

`-mno-fpu'
`-msoft-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
     *Warning:* there is no GNU floating-point library for SPARC.
     Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
     used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You
     must make your own arrangements to provide suitable library
     functions for cross-compilation.

     `-msoft-float' changes the calling convention in the output file;
     therefore, it is only useful if you compile *all* of a program with
     this option.  In particular, you need to compile `libgcc.a', the
     library that comes with GNU CC, with `-msoft-float' in order for
     this to work.

`-mhard-quad-float'
     Generate output containing quad-word (long double) floating point
     instructions.

`-msoft-quad-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long
     double) floating point instructions.  The functions called are
     those specified in the SPARC ABI.  This is the default.

     As of this writing, there are no sparc implementations that have
     hardware support for the quad-word floating point instructions.
     They all invoke a trap handler for one of these instructions, and
     then the trap handler emulates the effect of the instruction.
     Because of the trap handler overhead, this is much slower than
     calling the ABI library routines.  Thus the `-msoft-quad-float'
     option is the default.

`-mno-epilogue'
`-mepilogue'
     With `-mepilogue' (the default), the compiler always emits code for
     function exit at the end of each function.  Any function exit in
     the middle of the function (such as a return statement in C) will
     generate a jump to the exit code at the end of the function.

     With `-mno-epilogue', the compiler tries to emit exit code inline
     at every function exit.

`-mno-flat'
`-mflat'
     With `-mflat', the compiler does not generate save/restore
     instructions and will use a "flat" or single register window
     calling convention.  This model uses %i7 as the frame pointer and
     is compatible with the normal register window model.  Code from
     either may be intermixed although debugger support is still
     incomplete.  The local registers and the input registers (0-5) are
     still treated as "call saved" registers and will be saved on the
     stack as necessary.

     With `-mno-flat' (the default), the compiler emits save/restore
     instructions (except for leaf functions) and is the normal mode of
     operation.

`-mno-unaligned-doubles'
`-munaligned-doubles'
     Assume that doubles have 8 byte alignment.  This is the default.

     With `-munaligned-doubles', GNU CC assumes that doubles have 8 byte
     alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they
     have an absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes they have 4 byte
     alignment.  Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility
     problems with code generated by other compilers.  It is not the
     default because it results in a performance loss, especially for
     floating point code.

`-mv8'
`-msparclite'
     These two options select variations on the SPARC architecture.

     By default (unless specifically configured for the Fujitsu
     SPARClite), GCC generates code for the v7 variant of the SPARC
     architecture.

     `-mv8' will give you SPARC v8 code.  The only difference from v7
     code is that the compiler emits the integer multiply and integer
     divide instructions which exist in SPARC v8 but not in SPARC v7.

     `-msparclite' will give you SPARClite code.  This adds the integer
     multiply, integer divide step and scan (`ffs') instructions which
     exist in SPARClite but not in SPARC v7.

`-mcypress'
`-msupersparc'
     These two options select the processor for which the code is
     optimised.

     With `-mcypress' (the default), the compiler optimizes code for the
     Cypress CY7C602 chip, as used in the SparcStation/SparcServer 3xx
     series.  This is also apropriate for the older SparcStation 1, 2,
     IPX etc.

     With `-msupersparc' the compiler optimizes code for the SuperSparc
     cpu, as used in the SparcStation 10, 1000 and 2000 series. This
     flag also enables use of the full SPARC v8 instruction set.

   In a future version of GCC, these options will very likely be
renamed to `-mcpu=cypress' and `-mcpu=supersparc'.

   These `-m' switches are supported in addition to the above on SPARC
V9 processors:

`-mmedlow'
     Generate code for the Medium/Low code model: assume a 32 bit
     address space.  Programs are statically linked, PIC is not
     supported.  Pointers are still 64 bits.

     It is very likely that a future version of GCC will rename this
     option.

`-mmedany'
     Generate code for the Medium/Anywhere code model: assume a 32 bit
     text segment starting at offset 0, and a 32 bit data segment
     starting anywhere (determined at link time).  Programs are
     statically linked, PIC is not supported.  Pointers are still 64
     bits.

     It is very likely that a future version of GCC will rename this
     option.

`-mint64'
     Types long and int are 64 bits.

`-mlong32'
     Types long and int are 32 bits.

`-mlong64'
`-mint32'
     Type long is 64 bits, and type int is 32 bits.

`-mstack-bias'
`-mno-stack-bias'
     With `-mstack-bias', GNU CC assumes that the stack pointer, and
     frame pointer if present, are offset by -2047 which must be added
     back when making stack frame references.  Otherwise, assume no
     such offset is present.


Convex Options
--------------

   These `-m' options are defined for Convex:

`-mc1'
     Generate output for C1.  The code will run on any Convex machine.
     The preprocessor symbol `__convex__c1__' is defined.

`-mc2'
     Generate output for C2.  Uses instructions not available on C1.
     Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance
     on C2.  The preprocessor symbol `__convex_c2__' is defined.

`-mc32'
     Generate output for C32xx.  Uses instructions not available on C1.
     Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance
     on C32.  The preprocessor symbol `__convex_c32__' is defined.

`-mc34'
     Generate output for C34xx.  Uses instructions not available on C1.
     Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance
     on C34.  The preprocessor symbol `__convex_c34__' is defined.

`-mc38'
     Generate output for C38xx.  Uses instructions not available on C1.
     Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance
     on C38.  The preprocessor symbol `__convex_c38__' is defined.

`-margcount'
     Generate code which puts an argument count in the word preceding
     each argument list.  This is compatible with regular CC, and a few
     programs may need the argument count word.  GDB and other
     source-level debuggers do not need it; this info is in the symbol
     table.

`-mnoargcount'
     Omit the argument count word.  This is the default.

`-mvolatile-cache'
     Allow volatile references to be cached.  This is the default.

`-mvolatile-nocache'
     Volatile references bypass the data cache, going all the way to
     memory.  This is only needed for multi-processor code that does
     not use standard synchronization instructions.  Making
     non-volatile references to volatile locations will not necessarily
     work.

`-mlong32'
     Type long is 32 bits, the same as type int.  This is the default.

`-mlong64'
     Type long is 64 bits, the same as type long long.  This option is
     useless, because no library support exists for it.




AMD29K Options
--------------

   These `-m' options are defined for the AMD Am29000:

`-mdw'
     Generate code that assumes the `DW' bit is set, i.e., that byte and
     halfword operations are directly supported by the hardware.  This
     is the default.

`-mndw'
     Generate code that assumes the `DW' bit is not set.

`-mbw'
     Generate code that assumes the system supports byte and halfword
     write operations.  This is the default.

`-mnbw'
     Generate code that assumes the systems does not support byte and
     halfword write operations.  `-mnbw' implies `-mndw'.

`-msmall'
     Use a small memory model that assumes that all function addresses
     are either within a single 256 KB segment or at an absolute
     address of less than 256k.  This allows the `call' instruction to
     be used instead of a `const', `consth', `calli' sequence.

`-mnormal'
     Use the normal memory model: Generate `call' instructions only when
     calling functions in the same file and `calli' instructions
     otherwise.  This works if each file occupies less than 256 KB but
     allows the entire executable to be larger than 256 KB.  This is
     the default.

`-mlarge'
     Always use `calli' instructions.  Specify this option if you expect
     a single file to compile into more than 256 KB of code.

`-m29050'
     Generate code for the Am29050.

`-m29000'
     Generate code for the Am29000.  This is the default.

`-mkernel-registers'
     Generate references to registers `gr64-gr95' instead of to
     registers `gr96-gr127'.  This option can be used when compiling
     kernel code that wants a set of global registers disjoint from
     that used by user-mode code.

     Note that when this option is used, register names in `-f' flags
     must use the normal, user-mode, names.

`-muser-registers'
     Use the normal set of global registers, `gr96-gr127'.  This is the
     default.

`-mstack-check'
`-mno-stack-check'
     Insert (or do not insert) a call to `__msp_check' after each stack
     adjustment.  This is often used for kernel code.

`-mstorem-bug'
`-mno-storem-bug'
     `-mstorem-bug' handles 29k processors which cannot handle the
     separation of a mtsrim insn and a storem instruction (most 29000
     chips to date, but not the 29050).

`-mno-reuse-arg-regs'
`-mreuse-arg-regs'
     `-mno-reuse-arg-regs' tells the compiler to only use incoming
     argument registers for copying out arguments.  This helps detect
     calling a function with fewer arguments than it was declared with.

`-msoft-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not part of GNU CC.
     Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
     used, but this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You
     must make your own arrangements to provide suitable library
     functions for cross-compilation.




ARM Options
-----------

   These `-m' options are defined for Advanced RISC Machines (ARM)
architectures:

`-m2'
`-m3'
     These options are identical.  Generate code for the ARM2 and ARM3
     processors.  This option is the default.  You should also use this
     option to generate code for ARM6 processors that are running with a
     26-bit program counter.

`-m6'
     Generate code for the ARM6 processor when running with a 32-bit
     program counter.

`-mapcs'
     Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the ARM Proceedure
     Call Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly
     necessary for correct execution of the code.

`-mbsd'
     This option only applies to RISC iX.  Emulate the native BSD-mode
     compiler.  This is the default if `-ansi' is not specified.

`-mxopen'
     This option only applies to RISC iX.  Emulate the native
     X/Open-mode compiler.

`-mno-symrename'
     This option only applies to RISC iX.  Do not run the assembler
     post-processor, `symrename', after code has been assembled.
     Normally it is necessary to modify some of the standard symbols in
     preparation for linking with the RISC iX C library; this option
     suppresses this pass.  The post-processor is never run when the
     compiler is built for cross-compilation.




M88K Options
------------

   These `-m' options are defined for Motorola 88k architectures:

`-m88000'
     Generate code that works well on both the m88100 and the m88110.

`-m88100'
     Generate code that works best for the m88100, but that also runs
     on the m88110.

`-m88110'
     Generate code that works best for the m88110, and may not run on
     the m88100.

`-mbig-pic'
     Obsolete option to be removed from the next revision.  Use `-fPIC'.

`-midentify-revision'
     Include an `ident' directive in the assembler output recording the
     source file name, compiler name and version, timestamp, and
     compilation flags used.

`-mno-underscores'
     In assembler output, emit symbol names without adding an underscore
     character at the beginning of each name.  The default is to use an
     underscore as prefix on each name.

`-mocs-debug-info'
`-mno-ocs-debug-info'
     Include (or omit) additional debugging information (about
     registers used in each stack frame) as specified in the 88open
     Object Compatibility Standard, "OCS".  This extra information
     allows debugging of code that has had the frame pointer
     eliminated.  The default for DG/UX, SVr4, and Delta 88 SVr3.2 is
     to include this information; other 88k configurations omit this
     information by default.

`-mocs-frame-position'
     When emitting COFF debugging information for automatic variables
     and parameters stored on the stack, use the offset from the
     canonical frame address, which is the stack pointer (register 31)
     on entry to the function.  The DG/UX, SVr4, Delta88 SVr3.2, and
     BCS configurations use `-mocs-frame-position'; other 88k
     configurations have the default `-mno-ocs-frame-position'.

`-mno-ocs-frame-position'
     When emitting COFF debugging information for automatic variables
     and parameters stored on the stack, use the offset from the frame
     pointer register (register 30).  When this option is in effect,
     the frame pointer is not eliminated when debugging information is
     selected by the -g switch.

`-moptimize-arg-area'
`-mno-optimize-arg-area'
     Control how function arguments are stored in stack frames.
     `-moptimize-arg-area' saves space by optimizing them, but this
     conflicts with the 88open specifications.  The opposite
     alternative, `-mno-optimize-arg-area', agrees with 88open
     standards.  By default GNU CC does not optimize the argument area.

`-mshort-data-NUM'
     Generate smaller data references by making them relative to `r0',
     which allows loading a value using a single instruction (rather
     than the usual two).  You control which data references are
     affected by specifying NUM with this option.  For example, if you
     specify `-mshort-data-512', then the data references affected are
     those involving displacements of less than 512 bytes.
     `-mshort-data-NUM' is not effective for NUM greater than 64k.

`-mserialize-volatile'
`-mno-serialize-volatile'
     Do, or don't, generate code to guarantee sequential consistency of
     volatile memory references.  By default, consistency is guaranteed.

     The order of memory references made by the MC88110 processor does
     not always match the order of the instructions requesting those
     references.  In particular, a load instruction may execute before
     a preceding store instruction.  Such reordering violates
     sequential consistency of volatile memory references, when there
     are multiple processors.   When consistency must be guaranteed,
     GNU C generates special instructions, as needed, to force
     execution in the proper order.

     The MC88100 processor does not reorder memory references and so
     always provides sequential consistency.  However, by default, GNU
     C generates the special instructions to guarantee consistency even
     when you use `-m88100', so that the code may be run on an MC88110
     processor.  If you intend to run your code only on the MC88100
     processor, you may use `-mno-serialize-volatile'.

     The extra code generated to guarantee consistency may affect the
     performance of your application.  If you know that you can safely
     forgo this guarantee, you may use `-mno-serialize-volatile'.

`-msvr4'
`-msvr3'
     Turn on (`-msvr4') or off (`-msvr3') compiler extensions related
     to System V release 4 (SVr4).  This controls the following:

       1. Which variant of the assembler syntax to emit.

       2. `-msvr4' makes the C preprocessor recognize `#pragma weak'
          that is used on System V release 4.

       3. `-msvr4' makes GNU CC issue additional declaration directives
          used in SVr4.

     `-msvr4' is the default for the m88k-motorola-sysv4 and
     m88k-dg-dgux m88k configurations. `-msvr3' is the default for all
     other m88k configurations.

`-mversion-03.00'
     This option is obsolete, and is ignored.

`-mno-check-zero-division'
`-mcheck-zero-division'
     Do, or don't, generate code to guarantee that integer division by
     zero will be detected.  By default, detection is guaranteed.

     Some models of the MC88100 processor fail to trap upon integer
     division by zero under certain conditions.  By default, when
     compiling code that might be run on such a processor, GNU C
     generates code that explicitly checks for zero-valued divisors and
     traps with exception number 503 when one is detected.  Use of
     mno-check-zero-division suppresses such checking for code
     generated to run on an MC88100 processor.

     GNU C assumes that the MC88110 processor correctly detects all
     instances of integer division by zero.  When `-m88110' is
     specified, both `-mcheck-zero-division' and
     `-mno-check-zero-division' are ignored, and no explicit checks for
     zero-valued divisors are generated.

`-muse-div-instruction'
     Use the div instruction for signed integer division on the MC88100
     processor.  By default, the div instruction is not used.

     On the MC88100 processor the signed integer division instruction
     div) traps to the operating system on a negative operand.  The
     operating system transparently completes the operation, but at a
     large cost in execution time.  By default, when compiling code
     that might be run on an MC88100 processor, GNU C emulates signed
     integer division using the unsigned integer division instruction
     divu), thereby avoiding the large penalty of a trap to the
     operating system.  Such emulation has its own, smaller, execution
     cost in both time and space.  To the extent that your code's
     important signed integer division operations are performed on two
     nonnegative operands, it may be desirable to use the div
     instruction directly.

     On the MC88110 processor the div instruction (also known as the
     divs instruction) processes negative operands without trapping to
     the operating system.  When `-m88110' is specified,
     `-muse-div-instruction' is ignored, and the div instruction is used
     for signed integer division.

     Note that the result of dividing INT_MIN by -1 is undefined.  In
     particular, the behavior of such a division with and without
     `-muse-div-instruction'  may differ.

`-mtrap-large-shift'
`-mhandle-large-shift'
     Include code to detect bit-shifts of more than 31 bits;
     respectively, trap such shifts or emit code to handle them
     properly.  By default GNU CC makes no special provision for large
     bit shifts.

`-mwarn-passed-structs'
     Warn when a function passes a struct as an argument or result.
     Structure-passing conventions have changed during the evolution of
     the C language, and are often the source of portability problems.
     By default, GNU CC issues no such warning.




IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC Options
-------------------------------

   These `-m' options are defined for the IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC:
`-mpower'
`-mno-power'
`-mpower2'
`-mno-power2'
`-mpowerpc'
`-mno-powerpc'
`-mpowerpc-gpopt'
`-mno-powerpc-gpopt'
`-mpowerpc-gfxopt'
`-mno-powerpc-gfxopt'
     GNU CC supports two related instruction set architectures for the
     RS/6000 and PowerPC.  The "POWER" instruction set are those
     instructions supported by the `rios' chip set used in the original
     RS/6000 systems and the "PowerPC" instruction set is the
     architecture of the Motorola MPC6xx microprocessors.  The PowerPC
     architecture defines 64-bit instructions, but they are not
     supported by any current processors.

     Neither architecture is a subset of the other.  However there is a
     large common subset of instructions supported by both.  An MQ
     register is included in processors supporting the POWER
     architecture.

     You use these options to specify which instructions are available
     on the processor you are using.  The default value of these
     options is determined when configuring GNU CC.  Specifying the
     `-mcpu=CPU_TYPE' overrides the specification of these options.  We
     recommend you use that option rather than these.

     The `-mpower' option allows GNU CC to generate instructions that
     are found only in the POWER architecture and to use the MQ
     register.  Specifying `-mpower2' implies `-power' and also allows
     GNU CC to generate instructions that are present in the POWER2
     architecture but not the original POWER architecture.

     The `-mpowerpc' option allows GNU CC to generate instructions that
     are found only in the 32-bit subset of the PowerPC architecture.
     Specifying `-mpowerpc-gpopt' implies `-mpowerpc' and also allows
     GNU CC to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the
     General Purpose group, including floating-point square root.
     Specifying `-mpowerpc-gfxopt' implies `-mpowerpc' and also allows
     GNU CC to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in
     the Graphics group, including floating-point select.

     If you specify both `-mno-power' and `-mno-powerpc', GNU CC will
     use only the instructions in the common subset of both
     architectures plus some special AIX common-mode calls, and will
     not use the MQ register.  Specifying both `-mpower' and `-mpowerpc'
     permits GNU CC to use any instruction from either architecture and
     to allow use of the MQ register; specify this for the Motorola
     MPC601.

`-mnew-mnemonics'
`-mold-mnemonics'
     Select which mnemonics to use in the generated assembler code.
     `-mnew-mnemonics' requests output that uses the assembler mnemonics
     defined for the PowerPC architecture, while `-mold-mnemonics'
     requests the assembler mnemonics defined for the POWER
     architecture.  Instructions defined in only one architecture have
     only one mnemonic; GNU CC uses that mnemonic irrespective of which
     of thse options is specified.

     PowerPC assemblers support both the old and new mnemonics, as will
     later POWER assemblers.  Current POWER assemblers only support the
     old mnemonics.  Specify `-mnew-mnemonics' if you have an assembler
     that supports them, otherwise specify `-mold-mnemonics'.

     The default value of these options depends on how GNU CC was
     configured.  Specifing `-mcpu=CPU_TYPE' sometimes overrides the
     value of these option.  Unless you are building a cross-compiler,
     you should normally not specify either `-mnew-mnemonics' or
     `-mold-mnemonics', but should instead accept the default.

`-mcpu=CPU_TYPE'
     Set architecture type, register usage, choice of mnemonics, and
     instruction scheduling parameters for machine type CPU_TYPE.  By
     default, CPU_TYPE is the target system defined when GNU CC was
     configured.  Supported values for CPU_TYPE are `rios1', `rios2',
     `rsc', `601', `603', `604', `power', `powerpc', and `common'.
     `-mcpu=power' and `-mcpu=powerpc' specify generic POWER and pure
     PowerPC (i.e., not MPC601) architecture machine types, with an
     appropriate, generic processor model assumed for scheduling
     purposes.

     Specifying `-mcpu=rios1', `-mcpu=rios2', `-mcpu=rsc', or
     `-mcpu=power' enables the `-mpower' option and disables the
     `-mpowerpc' option; `-mcpu=601' enables both the `-mpower' and
     `-mpowerpc' options; `-mcpu=603', `-mcpu=604', and `-mcpu=powerpc'
     enable the `-mpowerpc' option and disable the `-mpower' option;
     `-mcpu=common' disables both the `-mpower' and `-mpowerpc' options.

     To generate code that will operate on all members of the RS/6000
     and PowerPC families, specify `-mcpu=common'.  In that case, GNU CC
     will use only the instructions in the common subset of both
     architectures plus some special AIX common-mode calls, and will
     not use the MQ register.  GNU CC assumes a generic processor model
     for scheduling purposes.

     Specifying `-mcpu=rios1', `-mcpu=rios2', `-mcpu=rsc', or
     `-mcpu=power' also disables the `new-mnemonics' option.
     Specifying `-mcpu=601', `-mcpu=603', `-mcpu=604', or
     `-mcpu=powerpc' also enables the `new-mnemonics' option.

`-mfull-toc'
`-mno-fp-in-toc'
`-mno-sum-in-toc'
`-mminimal-toc'
     Modify generation of the TOC (Table Of Contents), which is created
     for every executable file.  The `-mfull-toc' option is selected by
     default.  In that case, GNU CC will allocate at least one TOC
     entry for each unique non-automatic variable reference in your
     program.  GNU CC will also place floating-point constants in the
     TOC.  However, only 16,384 entries are available in the TOC.

     If you receive a linker error message that saying you have
     overflowed the available TOC space, you can reduce the amount of
     TOC space used with the `-mno-fp-in-toc' and `-mno-sum-in-toc'
     options.  `-mno-fp-in-toc' prevents GNU CC from putting
     floating-point constants in the TOC and `-mno-sum-in-toc' forces
     GNU CC to generate code to calculate the sum of an address and a
     constant at run-time instead of putting that sum into the TOC.
     You may specify one or both of these options.  Each causes GNU CC
     to produce very slightly slower and larger code at the expense of
     conserving TOC space.

     If you still run out of space in the TOC even when you specify
     both of these options, specify `-mminimal-toc' instead.  This
     option causes GNU CC to make only one TOC entry for every file.
     When you specify this option, GNU CC will produce code that is
     slower and larger but which uses extremely little TOC space.  You
     may wish to use this option only on files that contain less
     frequently executed code.




IBM RT Options
--------------

   These `-m' options are defined for the IBM RT PC:

`-min-line-mul'
     Use an in-line code sequence for integer multiplies.  This is the
     default.

`-mcall-lib-mul'
     Call `lmul$$' for integer multiples.

`-mfull-fp-blocks'
     Generate full-size floating point data blocks, including the
     minimum amount of scratch space recommended by IBM.  This is the
     default.

`-mminimum-fp-blocks'
     Do not include extra scratch space in floating point data blocks.
     This results in smaller code, but slower execution, since scratch
     space must be allocated dynamically.

`-mfp-arg-in-fpregs'
     Use a calling sequence incompatible with the IBM calling
     convention in which floating point arguments are passed in
     floating point registers.  Note that `varargs.h' and `stdargs.h'
     will not work with floating point operands if this option is
     specified.

`-mfp-arg-in-gregs'
     Use the normal calling convention for floating point arguments.
     This is the default.

`-mhc-struct-return'
     Return structures of more than one word in memory, rather than in a
     register.  This provides compatibility with the MetaWare HighC (hc)
     compiler.  Use the option `-fpcc-struct-return' for compatibility
     with the Portable C Compiler (pcc).

`-mnohc-struct-return'
     Return some structures of more than one word in registers, when
     convenient.  This is the default.  For compatibility with the
     IBM-supplied compilers, use the option `-fpcc-struct-return' or the
     option `-mhc-struct-return'.




MIPS Options
------------

   These `-m' options are defined for the MIPS family of computers:

`-mcpu=CPU TYPE'
     Assume the defaults for the machine type CPU TYPE when scheduling
     instructions.  The choices for CPU TYPE are `r2000', `r3000',
     `r4000', `r4400', `r4600', and `r6000'.  While picking a specific
     CPU TYPE will schedule things appropriately for that particular
     chip, the compiler will not generate any code that does not meet
     level 1 of the MIPS ISA (instruction set architecture) without the
     `-mips2' or `-mips3' switches being used.

`-mips1'
     Issue instructions from level 1 of the MIPS ISA.  This is the
     default.  `r3000' is the default CPU TYPE at this ISA level.

`-mips2'
     Issue instructions from level 2 of the MIPS ISA (branch likely,
     square root instructions).  `r6000' is the default CPU TYPE at this
     ISA level.

`-mips3'
     Issue instructions from level 3 of the MIPS ISA (64 bit
     instructions).  `r4000' is the default CPU TYPE at this ISA level.
     This option does not change the sizes of any of the C data types.

`-mfp32'
     Assume that 32 32-bit floating point registers are available.
     This is the default.

`-mfp64'
     Assume that 32 64-bit floating point registers are available.
     This is the default when the `-mips3' option is used.

`-mgp32'
     Assume that 32 32-bit general purpose registers are available.
     This is the default.

`-mgp64'
     Assume that 32 64-bit general purpose registers are available.
     This is the default when the `-mips3' option is used.

`-mint64'
     Types long, int, and pointer are 64 bits.  This works only if
     `-mips3' is also specified.

`-mlong64'
     Types long and pointer are 64 bits, and type int is 32 bits.  This
     works only if `-mips3' is also specified.

`-mmips-as'
     Generate code for the MIPS assembler, and invoke `mips-tfile' to
     add normal debug information.  This is the default for all
     platforms except for the OSF/1 reference platform, using the
     OSF/rose object format.  If the either of the `-gstabs' or
     `-gstabs+' switches are used, the `mips-tfile' program will
     encapsulate the stabs within MIPS ECOFF.

`-mgas'
     Generate code for the GNU assembler.  This is the default on the
     OSF/1 reference platform, using the OSF/rose object format.

`-mrnames'
`-mno-rnames'
     The `-mrnames' switch says to output code using the MIPS software
     names for the registers, instead of the hardware names (ie, A0
     instead of $4).  The only known assembler that supports this option
     is the Algorithmics assembler.

`-mgpopt'
`-mno-gpopt'
     The `-mgpopt' switch says to write all of the data declarations
     before the instructions in the text section, this allows the MIPS
     assembler to generate one word memory references instead of using
     two words for short global or static data items.  This is on by
     default if optimization is selected.

`-mstats'
`-mno-stats'
     For each non-inline function processed, the `-mstats' switch
     causes the compiler to emit one line to the standard error file to
     print statistics about the program (number of registers saved,
     stack size, etc.).

`-mmemcpy'
`-mno-memcpy'
     The `-mmemcpy' switch makes all block moves call the appropriate
     string function (`memcpy' or `bcopy') instead of possibly
     generating inline code.

`-mmips-tfile'
`-mno-mips-tfile'
     The `-mno-mips-tfile' switch causes the compiler not postprocess
     the object file with the `mips-tfile' program, after the MIPS
     assembler has generated it to add debug support.  If `mips-tfile'
     is not run, then no local variables will be available to the
     debugger.  In addition, `stage2' and `stage3' objects will have
     the temporary file names passed to the assembler embedded in the
     object file, which means the objects will not compare the same.
     The `-mno-mips-tfile' switch should only be used when there are
     bugs in the `mips-tfile' program that prevents compilation.

`-msoft-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not part of GNU CC.
     Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
     used, but this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You
     must make your own arrangements to provide suitable library
     functions for cross-compilation.

`-mhard-float'
     Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is
     the default if you use the unmodified sources.

`-mabicalls'
`-mno-abicalls'
     Emit (or do not emit) the pseudo operations `.abicalls',
     `.cpload', and `.cprestore' that some System V.4 ports use for
     position independent code.

`-mlong-calls'
`-mno-long-calls'
     Do all calls with the `JALR' instruction, which requires loading
     up a function's address into a register before the call.  You need
     to use this switch, if you call outside of the current 512
     megabyte segment to functions that are not through pointers.

`-mhalf-pic'
`-mno-half-pic'
     Put pointers to extern references into the data section and load
     them up, rather than put the references in the text section.

`-membedded-pic'
`-mno-embedded-pic'
     Generate PIC code suitable for some embedded systems.  All calls
     are made using PC relative address, and all data is addressed
     using the $gp register.  This requires GNU as and GNU ld which do
     most of the work.

`-membedded-data'
`-mno-embedded-data'
     Allocate variables to the read-only data section first if
     possible, then next in the small data section if possible,
     otherwise in data.  This gives slightly slower code than the
     default, but reduces the amount of RAM required when executing,
     and thus may be preferred for some embedded systems.

`-G NUM'
     Put global and static items less than or equal to NUM bytes into
     the small data or bss sections instead of the normal data or bss
     section.  This allows the assembler to emit one word memory
     reference instructions based on the global pointer (GP or $28),
     instead of the normal two words used.  By default, NUM is 8 when
     the MIPS assembler is used, and 0 when the GNU assembler is used.
     The `-G NUM' switch is also passed to the assembler and linker.
     All modules should be compiled with the same `-G NUM' value.

`-nocpp'
     Tell the MIPS assembler to not run it's preprocessor over user
     assembler files (with a `.s' suffix) when assembling them.

   These options are defined by the macro `TARGET_SWITCHES' in the
machine description.  The default for the options is also defined by
that macro, which enables you to change the defaults.




Intel 386 Options
-----------------

   These `-m' options are defined for the i386 family of computers:

`-m486'
`-mno-486'
     Control whether or not code is optimized for a 486 instead of an
     386.  Code generated for an 486 will run on a 386 and vice versa.

`-mieee-fp'
`-m-no-ieee-fp'
     Control whether or not the compiler uses IEEE floating point
     comparisons.  These handle correctly the case where the result of a
     comparison is unordered.

`-msoft-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not part of GNU CC.
     Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
     used, but this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You
     must make your own arrangements to provide suitable library
     functions for cross-compilation.

     On machines where a function returns floating point results in the
     80387 register stack, some floating point opcodes may be emitted
     even if `-msoft-float' is used.

`-mno-fp-ret-in-387'
     Do not use the FPU registers for return values of functions.

     The usual calling convention has functions return values of types
     `float' and `double' in an FPU register, even if there is no FPU.
     The idea is that the operating system should emulate an FPU.

     The option `-mno-fp-ret-in-387' causes such values to be returned
     in ordinary CPU registers instead.

`-mno-fancy-math-387'
     Some 387 emulators do not support the `sin', `cos' and `sqrt'
     instructions for the 387.  Specify this option to avoid generating
     those instructions. This option is the default on FreeBSD.  As of
     revision 2.6.1, these instructions are not generated unless you
     also use the `-ffast-math' switch.

`-msvr3-shlib'
`-mno-svr3-shlib'
     Control whether GNU CC places uninitialized locals into `bss' or
     `data'.  `-msvr3-shlib' places these locals into `bss'.  These
     options are meaningful only on System V Release 3.

`-mno-wide-multiply'
`-mwide-multiply'
     Control whether GNU CC uses the `mul' and `imul' that produce 64
     bit results in `eax:edx' from 32 bit operands to do `long long'
     multiplies and 32-bit division by constants.

`-mreg-alloc=REGS'
     Control the default allocation order of integer registers.  The
     string REGS is a series of letters specifing a register.  The
     supported letters are: `a' allocate EAX; `b' allocate EBX; `c'
     allocate ECX; `d' allocate EDX; `S' allocate ESI; `D' allocate
     EDI; `B' allocate EBP.




HPPA Options
------------

   These `-m' options are defined for the HPPA family of computers:

`-mpa-risc-1-0'
     Generate code for a PA 1.0 processor.

`-mpa-risc-1-1'
     Generate code for a PA 1.1 processor.

`-mjump-in-delay'
     Fill delay slots of function calls with unconditional jump
     instructions by modifying the return pointer for the function call
     to be the target of the conditional jump.

`-mlong-calls'
     Generate code which allows calls to functions greater than 256k
     away from the caller when the caller and callee are in the same
     source file.  Do not turn this option on unless code refuses to
     link with "branch out of range errors" from the linker.

`-mdisable-fpregs'
     Prevent floating point registers from being used in any manner.
     This is necessary for compiling kernels which perform lazy context
     switching of floating point registers.  If you use this option and
     attempt to perform floating point operations, the compiler will
     abort.

`-mdisable-indexing'
     Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes.  This
     avoids some rather obscure problems when compiling MIG generated
     code under MACH.

`-mportable-runtime'
     Use the portable calling conventions proposed by HP for ELF
     systems.  Note this option also enables `-mlong-calls'.

`-mgas'
     Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS understands.




Intel 960 Options
-----------------

   These `-m' options are defined for the Intel 960 implementations:

`-mCPU TYPE'
     Assume the defaults for the machine type CPU TYPE for some of the
     other options, including instruction scheduling, floating point
     support, and addressing modes.  The choices for CPU TYPE are `ka',
     `kb', `mc', `ca', `cf', `sa', and `sb'.  The default is `kb'.

`-mnumerics'
`-msoft-float'
     The `-mnumerics' option indicates that the processor does support
     floating-point instructions.  The `-msoft-float' option indicates
     that floating-point support should not be assumed.

`-mleaf-procedures'
`-mno-leaf-procedures'
     Do (or do not) attempt to alter leaf procedures to be callable
     with the `bal' instruction as well as `call'.  This will result in
     more efficient code for explicit calls when the `bal' instruction
     can be substituted by the assembler or linker, but less efficient
     code in other cases, such as calls via function pointers, or using
     a linker that doesn't support this optimization.

`-mtail-call'
`-mno-tail-call'
     Do (or do not) make additional attempts (beyond those of the
     machine-independent portions of the compiler) to optimize
     tail-recursive calls into branches.  You may not want to do this
     because the detection of cases where this is not valid is not
     totally complete.  The default is `-mno-tail-call'.

`-mcomplex-addr'
`-mno-complex-addr'
     Assume (or do not assume) that the use of a complex addressing
     mode is a win on this implementation of the i960.  Complex
     addressing modes may not be worthwhile on the K-series, but they
     definitely are on the C-series.  The default is currently
     `-mcomplex-addr' for all processors except the CB and CC.

`-mcode-align'
`-mno-code-align'
     Align code to 8-byte boundaries for faster fetching (or don't
     bother).  Currently turned on by default for C-series
     implementations only.

`-mic-compat'
`-mic2.0-compat'
`-mic3.0-compat'
     Enable compatibility with iC960 v2.0 or v3.0.

`-masm-compat'
`-mintel-asm'
     Enable compatibility with the iC960 assembler.

`-mstrict-align'
`-mno-strict-align'
     Do not permit (do permit) unaligned accesses.

`-mold-align'
     Enable structure-alignment compatibility with Intel's gcc release
     version 1.3 (based on gcc 1.37).  Currently this is buggy in that
     `#pragma align 1' is always assumed as well, and cannot be turned
     off.




DEC Alpha Options
-----------------

   These `-m' options are defined for the DEC Alpha implementations:

`-mno-soft-float'
`-msoft-float'
     Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
     floating-point operations.  When `-msoft-float' is specified,
     functions in `libgcc1.c' will be used to perform floating-point
     operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
     floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call
     such emulations routines, these routines will issue floating-point
     operations.   If you are compiling for an Alpha without
     floating-point operations, you must ensure that the library is
     built so as not to call them.

     Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations
     are required to have floating-point registers.

`-mfp-reg'
`-mno-fp-regs'
     Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register
     set.  `-mno-fp-regs' implies `-msoft-float'.  If the floating-point
     register set is not used, floating point operands are passed in
     integer registers as if they were integers and floating-point
     results are passed in $0 instead of $f0.  This is a non-standard
     calling sequence, so any function with a floating-point argument
     or return value called by code compiled with `-mno-fp-regs' must
     also be compiled with that option.

     A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not
     use, and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point
     registers.




Clipper Options
---------------

   These `-m' options are defined for the Clipper implementations:

`-mc300'
     Produce code for a C300 Clipper processor. This is the default.

`-mc400'
     Produce code for a C400 Clipper processor i.e. use floting point
     registers f8..f15.




H8/300 Options
--------------

   These `-m' options are defined for the H8/300 implementations:

`-mrelax'
     Shorten some address references at link time, when possible; uses
     the linker option `-relax'.  *Note `ld' and the H8/300:
     (ld.info)H8/300, for a fuller description.

`-mh'
     Generate code for the H8/300H.




Options for System V
--------------------

   These additional options are available on System V Release 4 for
compatibility with other compilers on those systems:

`-Qy'
     Identify the versions of each tool used by the compiler, in a
     `.ident' assembler directive in the output.

`-Qn'
     Refrain from adding `.ident' directives to the output file (this is
     the default).

`-YP,DIRS'
     Search the directories DIRS, and no others, for libraries
     specified with `-l'.

`-Ym,DIR'
     Look in the directory DIR to find the M4 preprocessor.  The
     assembler uses this option.




Options for Code Generation Conventions
=======================================

   These machine-independent options control the interface conventions
used in code generation.

   Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
of `-ffoo' would be `-fno-foo'.  In the table below, only one of the
forms is listed--the one which is not the default.  You can figure out
the other form by either removing `no-' or adding it.

`-fpcc-struct-return'
     Return "short" `struct' and `union' values in memory like longer
     ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less
     efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability
     between GNU CC-compiled files and files compiled with other
     compilers.

     The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends
     on the target configuration macros.

     Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment
     match that of some integer type.

`-freg-struct-return'
     Use the convention that `struct' and `union' values are returned
     in registers when possible.  This is more efficient for small
     structures than `-fpcc-struct-return'.

     If you specify neither `-fpcc-struct-return' nor its contrary
     `-freg-struct-return', GNU CC defaults to whichever convention is
     standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, GNU
     CC defaults to `-fpcc-struct-return', except on targets where GNU
     CC is the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the
     standard, and we chose the more efficient register return
     alternative.

`-fshort-enums'
     Allocate to an `enum' type only as many bytes as it needs for the
     declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the `enum' type
     will be equivalent to the smallest integer type which has enough
     room.

`-fshort-double'
     Use the same size for `double' as for `float'.

`-fshared-data'
     Requests that the data and non-`const' variables of this
     compilation be shared data rather than private data.  The
     distinction makes sense only on certain operating systems, where
     shared data is shared between processes running the same program,
     while private data exists in one copy per process.

`-fno-common'
     Allocate even uninitialized global variables in the bss section of
     the object file, rather than generating them as common blocks.
     This has the effect that if the same variable is declared (without
     `extern') in two different compilations, you will get an error
     when you link them.  The only reason this might be useful is if
     you wish to verify that the program will work on other systems
     which always work this way.

`-fno-ident'
     Ignore the `#ident' directive.

`-fno-gnu-linker'
     Do not output global initializations (such as C++ constructors and
     destructors) in the form used by the GNU linker (on systems where
     the GNU linker is the standard method of handling them).  Use this
     option when you want to use a non-GNU linker, which also requires
     using the `collect2' program to make sure the system linker
     includes constructors and destructors.  (`collect2' is included in
     the GNU CC distribution.)  For systems which *must* use
     `collect2', the compiler driver `gcc' is configured to do this
     automatically.

`-finhibit-size-directive'
     Don't output a `.size' assembler directive, or anything else that
     would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the
     two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This
     option is used when compiling `crtstuff.c'; you should not need to
     use it for anything else.

`-fverbose-asm'
     Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
     make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to
     those who actually need to read the generated assembly code
     (perhaps while debugging the compiler itself).

`-fvolatile'
     Consider all memory references through pointers to be volatile.

`-fvolatile-global'
     Consider all memory references to extern and global data items to
     be volatile.

`-fpic'
     Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in a
     shared library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code
     accesses all constant addresses through a global offset table
     (GOT).  If the GOT size for the linked executable exceeds a
     machine-specific maximum size, you get an error message from the
     linker indicating that `-fpic' does not work; in that case,
     recompile with `-fPIC' instead.  (These maximums are 16k on the
     m88k, 8k on the Sparc, and 32k on the m68k and RS/6000.  The 386
     has no such limit.)

     Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore
     works only on certain machines.  For the 386, GNU CC supports PIC
     for System V but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the IBM
     RS/6000 is always position-independent.

     The GNU assembler does not fully support PIC.  Currently, you must
     use some other assembler in order for PIC to work.  We would
     welcome volunteers to upgrade GAS to handle this; the first part
     of the job is to figure out what the assembler must do differently.

`-fPIC'
     If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent
     code, suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the
     size of the global offset table.  This option makes a difference
     on the m68k, m88k and the Sparc.

     Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore
     works only on certain machines.

`-ffixed-REG'
     Treat the register named REG as a fixed register; generated code
     should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame
     pointer or in some other fixed role).

     REG must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
     are machine-specific and are defined in the `REGISTER_NAMES' macro
     in the machine description macro file.

     This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
     three-way choice.

`-fcall-used-REG'
     Treat the register named REG as an allocatable register that is
     clobbered by function calls.  It may be allocated for temporaries
     or variables that do not live across a call.  Functions compiled
     this way will not save and restore the register REG.

     Use of this flag for a register that has a fixed pervasive role in
     the machine's execution model, such as the stack pointer or frame
     pointer, will produce disastrous results.

     This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
     three-way choice.

`-fcall-saved-REG'
     Treat the register named REG as an allocatable register saved by
     functions.  It may be allocated even for temporaries or variables
     that live across a call.  Functions compiled this way will save
     and restore the register REG if they use it.

     Use of this flag for a register that has a fixed pervasive role in
     the machine's execution model, such as the stack pointer or frame
     pointer, will produce disastrous results.

     A different sort of disaster will result from the use of this flag
     for a register in which function values may be returned.

     This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
     three-way choice.

`+e0'
`+e1'
     Control whether virtual function definitions in classes are used to
     generate code, or only to define interfaces for their callers.
     (C++ only).

     These options are provided for compatibility with `cfront' 1.x
     usage; the recommended alternative GNU C++ usage is in flux.
     *Note Declarations and Definitions in One Header: C++ Interface.

     With `+e0', virtual function definitions in classes are declared
     `extern'; the declaration is used only as an interface
     specification, not to generate code for the virtual functions (in
     this compilation).

     With `+e1', G++ actually generates the code implementing virtual
     functions defined in the code, and makes them publicly visible.


Environment Variables Affecting GNU CC
======================================

   This section describes several environment variables that affect how
GNU CC operates.  They work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.

   Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
`-B', `-I' and `-L' (*note Directory Options::.).  These take
precedence over places specified using environment variables, which in
turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of GNU
CC.  *Note Driver::.

`TMPDIR'
     If `TMPDIR' is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
     files.  GNU CC uses temporary files to hold the output of one
     stage of compilation which is to be used as input to the next
     stage: for example, the output of the preprocessor, which is the
     input to the compiler proper.

`GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'
     If `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX' is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
     names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is
     added when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram,
     but you can specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.

     If GNU CC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
     tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.

     The default value of `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX' is
     `PREFIX/lib/gcc-lib/MACHINE/VERSION/' where PREFIX is the value of
     `prefix' when you ran the `configure' script and MACHINE and
     VERSION are the configuration name and version number of GNU CC,
     respectively.

     Other prefixes specified with `-B' take precedence over this
     prefix.

     This prefix is also used for finding files such as `crt0.o' that
     are used for linking.

     In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
     directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
     directories whose name normally begins with
     `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib' (more precisely, with the value of
     `GCC_INCLUDE_DIR'), GNU CC tries replacing that beginning with the
     specified prefix to produce an alternate directory name.  Thus,
     with `-Bfoo/', GNU CC will search `foo/bar' where it would
     normally search `/usr/local/lib/bar'.  These alternate directories
     are searched first; the standard directories come next.

`COMPILER_PATH'
     The value of `COMPILER_PATH' is a colon-separated list of
     directories, much like `PATH'.  GNU CC tries the directories thus
     specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
     subprograms using `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'.

`LIBRARY_PATH'
     The value of `LIBRARY_PATH' is a colon-separated list of
     directories, much like `PATH'.  GNU CC tries the directories thus
     specified when searching for special linker files, if it can't
     find them using `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'.  Linking using GNU CC also uses
     these directories when searching for ordinary libraries for the
     `-l' option (but directories specified with `-L' come first).

`C_INCLUDE_PATH'
`CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH'
`OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH'
     These environment variables pertain to particular languages.  Each
     variable's value is a colon-separated list of directories, much
     like `PATH'.  When GNU CC searches for header files, it tries the
     directories listed in the variable for the language you are using,
     after the directories specified with `-I' but before the standard
     header file directories.

`DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT'
     If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
     dependencies for Make based on the header files processed by the
     compiler.  This output looks much like the output from the `-M'
     option (*note Preprocessor Options::.), but it goes to a separate
     file, and is in addition to the usual results of compilation.

     The value of `DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT' can be just a file name, in
     which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the
     target name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the
     form `FILE TARGET', in which case the rules are written to file
     FILE using TARGET as the target name.




Running Protoize
================

   The program `protoize' is an optional part of GNU C.  You can use it
to add prototypes to a program, thus converting the program to ANSI C
in one respect.  The companion program `unprotoize' does the reverse:
it removes argument types from any prototypes that are found.

   When you run these programs, you must specify a set of source files
as command line arguments.  The conversion programs start out by
compiling these files to see what functions they define.  The
information gathered about a file FOO is saved in a file named `FOO.X'.

   After scanning comes actual conversion.  The specified files are all
eligible to be converted; any files they include (whether sources or
just headers) are eligible as well.

   But not all the eligible files are converted.  By default,
`protoize' and `unprotoize' convert only source and header files in the
current directory.  You can specify additional directories whose files
should be converted with the `-d DIRECTORY' option.  You can also
specify particular files to exclude with the `-x FILE' option.  A file
is converted if it is eligible, its directory name matches one of the
specified directory names, and its name within the directory has not
been excluded.

   Basic conversion with `protoize' consists of rewriting most function
definitions and function declarations to specify the types of the
arguments.  The only ones not rewritten are those for varargs functions.

   `protoize' optionally inserts prototype declarations at the
beginning of the source file, to make them available for any calls that
precede the function's definition.  Or it can insert prototype
declarations with block scope in the blocks where undeclared functions
are called.

   Basic conversion with `unprotoize' consists of rewriting most
function declarations to remove any argument types, and rewriting
function definitions to the old-style pre-ANSI form.

   Both conversion programs print a warning for any function
declaration or definition that they can't convert.  You can suppress
these warnings with `-q'.

   The output from `protoize' or `unprotoize' replaces the original
source file.  The original file is renamed to a name ending with
`.save'.  If the `.save' file already exists, then the source file is
simply discarded.

   `protoize' and `unprotoize' both depend on GNU CC itself to scan the
program and collect information about the functions it uses.  So
neither of these programs will work until GNU CC is installed.

   Here is a table of the options you can use with `protoize' and
`unprotoize'.  Each option works with both programs unless otherwise
stated.

`-B DIRECTORY'
     Look for the file `SYSCALLS.c.X' in DIRECTORY, instead of the
     usual directory (normally `/usr/local/lib').  This file contains
     prototype information about standard system functions.  This option
     applies only to `protoize'.

`-c COMPILATION-OPTIONS'
     Use  COMPILATION-OPTIONS as the options when running `gcc' to
     produce the `.X' files.  The special option `-aux-info' is always
     passed in addition, to tell `gcc' to write a `.X' file.

     Note that the compilation options must be given as a single
     argument to `protoize' or `unprotoize'.  If you want to specify
     several `gcc' options, you must quote the entire set of
     compilation options to make them a single word in the shell.

     There are certain `gcc' arguments that you cannot use, because they
     would produce the wrong kind of output.  These include `-g', `-O',
     `-c', `-S', and `-o' If you include these in the
     COMPILATION-OPTIONS, they are ignored.

`-C'
     Rename files to end in `.C' instead of `.c'.  This is convenient
     if you are converting a C program to C++.  This option applies
     only to `protoize'.

`-g'
     Add explicit global declarations.  This means inserting explicit
     declarations at the beginning of each source file for each function
     that is called in the file and was not declared.  These
     declarations precede the first function definition that contains a
     call to an undeclared function.  This option applies only to
     `protoize'.

`-i STRING'
     Indent old-style parameter declarations with the string STRING.
     This option applies only to `protoize'.

     `unprotoize' converts prototyped function definitions to old-style
     function definitions, where the arguments are declared between the
     argument list and the initial `{'.  By default, `unprotoize' uses
     five spaces as the indentation.  If you want to indent with just
     one space instead, use `-i " "'.

`-k'
     Keep the `.X' files.  Normally, they are deleted after conversion
     is finished.

`-l'
     Add explicit local declarations.  `protoize' with `-l' inserts a
     prototype declaration for each function in each block which calls
     the function without any declaration.  This option applies only to
     `protoize'.

`-n'
     Make no real changes.  This mode just prints information about the
     conversions that would have been done without `-n'.

`-N'
     Make no `.save' files.  The original files are simply deleted.
     Use this option with caution.

`-p PROGRAM'
     Use the program PROGRAM as the compiler.  Normally, the name `gcc'
     is used.

`-q'
     Work quietly.  Most warnings are suppressed.

`-v'
     Print the version number, just like `-v' for `gcc'.

   If you need special compiler options to compile one of your program's
source files, then you should generate that file's `.X' file specially,
by running `gcc' on that source file with the appropriate options and
the option `-aux-info'.  Then run `protoize' on the entire set of
files.  `protoize' will use the existing `.X' file because it is newer
than the source file.  For example:

     gcc -Dfoo=bar file1.c -aux-info
     protoize *.c

You need to include the special files along with the rest in the
`protoize' command, even though their `.X' files already exist, because
otherwise they won't get converted.

   *Note Protoize Caveats::, for more information on how to use
`protoize' successfully.




Installing GNU CC
*****************


   Here is the procedure for installing GNU CC on a Unix system.  See
*Note VMS Install::, for VMS systems.  In this section we assume you
compile in the same directory that contains the source files; see *Note
Other Dir::, to find out how to compile in a separate directory on Unix
systems.

   You cannot install GNU C by itself on MSDOS; it will not compile
under any MSDOS compiler except itself.  You need to get the complete
compilation package DJGPP, which includes binaries as well as sources,
and includes all the necessary compilation tools and libraries.

  1. If you have built GNU CC previously in the same directory for a
     different target machine, do `make distclean' to delete all files
     that might be invalid.  One of the files this deletes is
     `Makefile'; if `make distclean' complains that `Makefile' does not
     exist, it probably means that the directory is already suitably
     clean.

  2. On a System V release 4 system, make sure `/usr/bin' precedes
     `/usr/ucb' in `PATH'.  The `cc' command in `/usr/ucb' uses
     libraries which have bugs.

  3. Specify the host, build and target machine configurations.  You do
     this by running the file `configure'.

     The "build" machine is the system which you are using, the "host"
     machine is the system where you want to run the resulting compiler
     (normally the build machine), and the "target" machine is the
     system for which you want the compiler to generate code.

     If you are building a compiler to produce code for the machine it
     runs on (a native compiler), you normally do not need to specify
     any operands to `configure'; it will try to guess the type of
     machine you are on and use that as the build, host and target
     machines.  So you don't need to specify a configuration when
     building a native compiler unless `configure' cannot figure out
     what your configuration is or guesses wrong.

     In those cases, specify the build machine's "configuration name"
     with the `--build' option; the host and target will default to be
     the same as the build machine.  (If you are building a
     cross-compiler, see *Note Cross-Compiler::.)

     Here is an example:

          ./configure --build=sparc-sun-sunos4.1

     A configuration name may be canonical or it may be more or less
     abbreviated.

     A canonical configuration name has three parts, separated by
     dashes.  It looks like this: `CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM'.  (The three
     parts may themselves contain dashes; `configure' can figure out
     which dashes serve which purpose.)  For example,
     `m68k-sun-sunos4.1' specifies a Sun 3.

     You can also replace parts of the configuration by nicknames or
     aliases.  For example, `sun3' stands for `m68k-sun', so
     `sun3-sunos4.1' is another way to specify a Sun 3.  You can also
     use simply `sun3-sunos', since the version of SunOS is assumed by
     default to be version 4.  `sun3-bsd' also works, since `configure'
     knows that the only BSD variant on a Sun 3 is SunOS.

     You can specify a version number after any of the system types,
     and some of the CPU types.  In most cases, the version is
     irrelevant, and will be ignored.  So you might as well specify the
     version if you know it.

     See *Note Configurations::, for a list of supported configuration
     names and notes on many of the configurations.  You should check
     the notes in that section before proceding any further with the
     installation of GNU CC.

     There are four additional options you can specify independently to
     describe variant hardware and software configurations.  These are
     `--with-gnu-as', `--with-gnu-ld', `--with-stabs' and `--nfp'.

    `--with-gnu-as'
          If you will use GNU CC with the GNU assembler (GAS), you
          should declare this by using the `--with-gnu-as' option when
          you run `configure'.

          Using this option does not install GAS.  It only modifies the
          output of GNU CC to work with GAS.  Building and installing
          GAS is up to you.

          Conversely, if you *do not* wish to use GAS and do not specify
          `--with-gnu-as' when building GNU CC, it is up to you to make
          sure that GAS is not installed.  GNU CC searches for a
          program named `as' in various directories; if the program it
          finds is GAS, then it runs GAS.  If you are not sure where
          GNU CC finds the assembler it is using, try specifying `-v'
          when you run it.

          The systems where it makes a difference whether you use GAS
          are
          `hppa1.0-ANY-ANY', `hppa1.1-ANY-ANY', `i386-ANY-sysv',
          `i386-ANY-isc',
          `i860-ANY-bsd', `m68k-bull-sysv', `m68k-hp-hpux',
          `m68k-sony-bsd',
          `m68k-altos-sysv', `m68000-hp-hpux', `m68000-att-sysv', and
          `mips-ANY').  On any other system, `--with-gnu-as' has no
          effect.

          On the systems listed above (except for the HP-PA, for ISC on
          the 386, and for `mips-sgi-irix5.*'), if you use GAS, you
          should also use the GNU linker (and specify `--with-gnu-ld').

    `--with-gnu-ld'
          Specify the option `--with-gnu-ld' if you plan to use the GNU
          linker with GNU CC.

          This option does not cause the GNU linker to be installed; it
          just modifies the behavior of GNU CC to work with the GNU
          linker.  Specifically, it inhibits the installation of
          `collect2', a program which otherwise serves as a front-end
          for the system's linker on most configurations.

    `--with-stabs'
          On MIPS based systems and on Alphas, you must specify whether
          you want GNU CC to create the normal ECOFF debugging format,
          or to use BSD-style stabs passed through the ECOFF symbol
          table.  The normal ECOFF debug format cannot fully handle
          languages other than C.  BSD stabs format can handle other
          languages, but it only works with the GNU debugger GDB.

          Normally, GNU CC uses the ECOFF debugging format by default;
          if you prefer BSD stabs, specify `--with-stabs' when you
          configure GNU CC.

          No matter which default you choose when you configure GNU CC,
          the user can use the `-gcoff' and `-gstabs+' options to
          specify explicitly the debug format for a particular
          compilation.

          `--with-stabs' is meaningful on the ISC system on the 386,
          also, if `--with-gas' is used.  It selects use of stabs
          debugging information embedded in COFF output.  This kind of
          debugging information supports C++ well; ordinary COFF
          debugging information does not.

          `--with-stabs' is also meaningful on 386 systems running
          SVR4.  It selects use of stabs debugging information embedded
          in ELF output.  The C++ compiler currently (2.6.0) does not
          support the DWARF debugging information normally used on 386
          SVR4 platforms; stabs provide a workable alternative.  This
          requires gas and gdb, as the normal SVR4 tools can not
          generate or interpret stabs.

    `--nfp'
          On certain systems, you must specify whether the machine has
          a floating point unit.  These systems include
          `m68k-sun-sunosN' and `m68k-isi-bsd'.  On any other system,
          `--nfp' currently has no effect, though perhaps there are
          other systems where it could usefully make a difference.

     The `configure' script searches subdirectories of the source
     directory for other compilers that are to be integrated into GNU
     CC.  The GNU compiler for C++, called G++ is in a subdirectory
     named `cp'.  `configure' inserts rules into `Makefile' to build
     all of those compilers.

     Here we spell out what files will be set up by `configure'.
     Normally you need not be concerned with these files.

        * A symbolic link named `config.h' is made to the top-level
          config file for the machine you will run the compiler on
          (*note Config::.).  This file is responsible for defining
          information about the host machine.  It includes `tm.h'.

          The top-level config file is located in the subdirectory
          `config'.  Its name is always `xm-SOMETHING.h'; usually
          `xm-MACHINE.h', but there are some exceptions.

          If your system does not support symbolic links, you might
          want to set up `config.h' to contain a `#include' command
          which refers to the appropriate file.

        * A symbolic link named `tconfig.h' is made to the top-level
          config file for your target machine.  This is used for
          compiling certain programs to run on that machine.

        * A symbolic link named `tm.h' is made to the
          machine-description macro file for your target machine.  It
          should be in the subdirectory `config' and its name is often
          `MACHINE.h'.

        * A symbolic link named `md' will be made to the machine
          description pattern file.  It should be in the `config'
          subdirectory and its name should be `MACHINE.md'; but MACHINE
          is often not the same as the name used in the `tm.h' file
          because the `md' files are more general.

        * A symbolic link named `aux-output.c' will be made to the
          output subroutine file for your machine.  It should be in the
          `config' subdirectory and its name should be `MACHINE.c'.

        * The command file `configure' also constructs the file
          `Makefile' by adding some text to the template file
          `Makefile.in'.  The additional text comes from files in the
          `config' directory, named `t-TARGET' and `x-HOST'.  If these
          files do not exist, it means nothing needs to be added for a
          given target or host.

  4. The standard directory for installing GNU CC is `/usr/local/lib'.
     If you want to install its files somewhere else, specify
     `--prefix=DIR' when you run `configure'.  Here DIR is a directory
     name to use instead of `/usr/local' for all purposes with one
     exception: the directory `/usr/local/include' is searched for
     header files no matter where you install the compiler.  To override
     this name, use the `--local-prefix' option below.

  5. Specify `--local-prefix=DIR' if you want the compiler to search
     directory `DIR/include' for locally installed header files
     *instead* of `/usr/local/include'.

     You should specify `--local-prefix' *only* if your site has a
     different convention (not `/usr/local') for where to put
     site-specific files.

     *Do not* specify `/usr' as the `--local-prefix'!  The directory
     you use for `--local-prefix' *must not* contain any of the
     system's standard header files.  If it did contain them, certain
     programs would be miscompiled (including GNU Emacs, on certain
     targets), because this would override and nullify the header file
     corrections made by the `fixincludes' script.

  6. Make sure the Bison parser generator is installed.  (This is
     unnecessary if the Bison output files `c-parse.c' and `cexp.c' are
     more recent than `c-parse.y' and `cexp.y' and you do not plan to
     change the `.y' files.)

     Bison versions older than Sept 8, 1988 will produce incorrect
     output for `c-parse.c'.

  7. If you have chosen a configuration for GNU CC which requires other
     GNU tools (such as GAS or the GNU linker) instead of the standard
     system tools, install the required tools in the build directory
     under the names `as', `ld' or whatever is appropriate.  This will
     enable the compiler to find the proper tools for compilation of
     the program `enquire'.

     Alternatively, you can do subsequent compilation using a value of
     the `PATH' environment variable such that the necessary GNU tools
     come before the standard system tools.

  8. Build the compiler.  Just type `make LANGUAGES=c' in the compiler
     directory.

     `LANGUAGES=c' specifies that only the C compiler should be
     compiled.  The makefile normally builds compilers for all the
     supported languages; currently, C, C++ and Objective C.  However,
     C is the only language that is sure to work when you build with
     other non-GNU C compilers.  In addition, building anything but C
     at this stage is a waste of time.

     In general, you can specify the languages to build by typing the
     argument `LANGUAGES="LIST"', where LIST is one or more words from
     the list `c', `c++', and `objective-c'.  If you have any
     additional GNU compilers as subdirectories of the GNU CC source
     directory, you may also specify their names in this list.

     Ignore any warnings you may see about "statement not reached" in
     `insn-emit.c'; they are normal.  Also, warnings about "unknown
     escape sequence" are normal in `genopinit.c' and perhaps some
     other files.  Likewise, you should ignore warnings about "constant
     is so large that it is unsigned" in `insn-emit.c' and
     `insn-recog.c'.  Any other compilation errors may represent bugs in
     the port to your machine or operating system, and should be
     investigated and reported (*note Bugs::.).

     Some commercial compilers fail to compile GNU CC because they have
     bugs or limitations.  For example, the Microsoft compiler is said
     to run out of macro space.  Some Ultrix compilers run out of
     expression space; then you need to break up the statement where
     the problem happens.

  9. If you are building a cross-compiler, stop here.  *Note
     Cross-Compiler::.

 10. Move the first-stage object files and executables into a
     subdirectory with this command:

          make stage1

     The files are moved into a subdirectory named `stage1'.  Once
     installation is complete, you may wish to delete these files with
     `rm -r stage1'.

 11. If you have chosen a configuration for GNU CC which requires other
     GNU tools (such as GAS or the GNU linker) instead of the standard
     system tools, install the required tools in the `stage1'
     subdirectory under the names `as', `ld' or whatever is
     appropriate.  This will enable the stage 1 compiler to find the
     proper tools in the following stage.

     Alternatively, you can do subsequent compilation using a value of
     the `PATH' environment variable such that the necessary GNU tools
     come before the standard system tools.

 12. Recompile the compiler with itself, with this command:

          make CC="stage1/xgcc -Bstage1/" CFLAGS="-g -O"

     This is called making the stage 2 compiler.

     The command shown above builds compilers for all the supported
     languages.  If you don't want them all, you can specify the
     languages to build by typing the argument `LANGUAGES="LIST"'.  LIST
     should contain one or more words from the list `c', `c++',
     `objective-c', and `proto'.  Separate the words with spaces.
     `proto' stands for the programs `protoize' and `unprotoize'; they
     are not a separate language, but you use `LANGUAGES' to enable or
     disable their installation.

     If you are going to build the stage 3 compiler, then you might
     want to build only the C language in stage 2.

     Once you have built the stage 2 compiler, if you are short of disk
     space, you can delete the subdirectory `stage1'.

     On a 68000 or 68020 system lacking floating point hardware, unless
     you have selected a `tm.h' file that expects by default that there
     is no such hardware, do this instead:

          make CC="stage1/xgcc -Bstage1/" CFLAGS="-g -O -msoft-float"

 13. If you wish to test the compiler by compiling it with itself one
     more time, install any other necessary GNU tools (such as GAS or
     the GNU linker) in the `stage2' subdirectory as you did in the
     `stage1' subdirectory, then do this:

          make stage2
          make CC="stage2/xgcc -Bstage2/" CFLAGS="-g -O"

     This is called making the stage 3 compiler.  Aside from the `-B'
     option, the compiler options should be the same as when you made
     the stage 2 compiler.  But the `LANGUAGES' option need not be the
     same.  The command shown above builds compilers for all the
     supported languages; if you don't want them all, you can specify
     the languages to build by typing the argument `LANGUAGES="LIST"',
     as described above.

     If you do not have to install any additional GNU tools, you may
     use the command

          make bootstrap LANGUAGES=LANGUAGE-LIST BOOT_CFLAGS=OPTION-LIST

     instead of making `stage1', `stage2', and performing the two
     compiler builds.

 14. Then compare the latest object files with the stage 2 object
     files--they ought to be identical, aside from time stamps (if any).

     On some systems, meaningful comparison of object files is
     impossible; they always appear "different."  This is currently
     true on Solaris and probably on all systems that use ELF object
     file format.  On some versions of Irix on SGI machines and OSF/1
     on Alpha systems, you will not be able to compare the files
     without specifying `-save-temps'; see the description of
     individual systems above to see if you get comparison failures.
     You may have similar problems on other systems.

     Use this command to compare the files:

          make compare

     This will mention any object files that differ between stage 2 and
     stage 3.  Any difference, no matter how innocuous, indicates that
     the stage 2 compiler has compiled GNU CC incorrectly, and is
     therefore a potentially serious bug which you should investigate
     and report (*note Bugs::.).

     If your system does not put time stamps in the object files, then
     this is a faster way to compare them (using the Bourne shell):

          for file in *.o; do
          cmp $file stage2/$file
          done

     If you have built the compiler with the `-mno-mips-tfile' option on
     MIPS machines, you will not be able to compare the files.

 15. Build the Objective C library (if you have built the Objective C
     compiler).  Here is the command to do this:

          make objc-runtime CC="stage2/xgcc -Bstage2/" CFLAGS="-g -O"

 16. Install the compiler driver, the compiler's passes and run-time
     support with `make install'.  Use the same value for `CC',
     `CFLAGS' and `LANGUAGES' that you used when compiling the files
     that are being installed.  One reason this is necessary is that
     some versions of Make have bugs and recompile files gratuitously
     when you do this step.  If you use the same variable values, those
     files will be recompiled properly.

     For example, if you have built the stage 2 compiler, you can use
     the following command:

          make install CC="stage2/xgcc -Bstage2/" CFLAGS="-g -O"
LANGUAGES="LIST"

     This copies the files `cc1', `cpp' and `libgcc.a' to files `cc1',
     `cpp' and `libgcc.a' in the directory
     `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/TARGET/VERSION', which is where the
     compiler driver program looks for them.  Here TARGET is the target
     machine type specified when you ran `configure', and VERSION is
     the version number of GNU CC.  This naming scheme permits various
     versions and/or cross-compilers to coexist.

     This also copies the driver program `xgcc' into
     `/usr/local/bin/gcc', so that it appears in typical execution
     search paths.

     On some systems, this command causes recompilation of some files.
     This is usually due to bugs in `make'.  You should either ignore
     this problem, or use GNU Make.

     *Warning: there is a bug in `alloca' in the Sun library.  To avoid
     this bug, be sure to install the executables of GNU CC that were
     compiled by GNU CC.  (That is, the executables from stage 2 or 3,
     not stage 1.)  They use `alloca' as a built-in function and never
     the one in the library.*

     (It is usually better to install GNU CC executables from stage 2
     or 3, since they usually run faster than the ones compiled with
     some other compiler.)

 17. Install the Objective C library (if you are installing the
     Objective C compiler).  Here is the command to do this:

          make install-libobjc CC="stage2/xgcc -Bstage2/" CFLAGS="-g -O"

 18. If you're going to use C++, it's likely that you need to also
     install the libg++ distribution.  It should be available from the
     same place where you got the GNU C distribution.  Just as GNU C
     does not distribute a C runtime library, it also does not include
     a C++ run-time library.  All I/O functionality, special class
     libraries, etc., are available in the libg++ distribution.

Configurations Supported by GNU CC
==================================

   Here are the possible CPU types:

     1750a, a29k, alpha, arm, cN, clipper, dsp16xx, elxsi, h8300,
     hppa1.0, hppa1.1, i370, i386, i486, i860, i960, m68000, m68k, m88k,
     mips, ns32k, powerpc, pyramid, romp, rs6000, sh, sparc, sparclite,
     sparc64, vax, we32k.

   Here are the recognized company names.  As you can see, customary
abbreviations are used rather than the longer official names.

     acorn, alliant, altos, apollo, att, bull, cbm, convergent, convex,
     crds, dec, dg, dolphin, elxsi, encore, harris, hitachi, hp, ibm,
     intergraph, isi, mips, motorola, ncr, next, ns, omron, plexus,
     sequent, sgi, sony, sun, tti, unicom.

   The company name is meaningful only to disambiguate when the rest of
the information supplied is insufficient.  You can omit it, writing
just `CPU-SYSTEM', if it is not needed.  For example, `vax-ultrix4.2'
is equivalent to `vax-dec-ultrix4.2'.

   Here is a list of system types:

     386bsd, aix, acis, amigados, aos, aout, bosx, bsd, clix, ctix,
     cxux, dgux, dynix, ebmon, elf, esix, freebsd, hms, genix, gnu,
     gnu/linux, hiux, hpux, iris, irix, isc, luna, lynxos, mach, minix,
     msdos, mvs, netbsd, newsos, nindy, ns, osf, osfrose, ptx, riscix,
     riscos, rtu, sco, solaris, sunos, sym, sysv, ultrix, unicos,
     uniplus, unos, vms, vxworks, xenix.

You can omit the system type; then `configure' guesses the operating
system from the CPU and company.

   You can add a version number to the system type; this may or may not
make a difference.  For example, you can write `bsd4.3' or `bsd4.4' to
distinguish versions of BSD.  In practice, the version number is most
needed for `sysv3' and `sysv4', which are often treated differently.

   If you specify an impossible combination such as `i860-dg-vms', then
you may get an error message from `configure', or it may ignore part of
the information and do the best it can with the rest.  `configure'
always prints the canonical name for the alternative that it used.  GNU
CC does not support all possible alternatives.

   Often a particular model of machine has a name.  Many machine names
are recognized as aliases for CPU/company combinations.  Thus, the
machine name `sun3', mentioned above, is an alias for `m68k-sun'.
Sometimes we accept a company name as a machine name, when the name is
popularly used for a particular machine.  Here is a table of the known
machine names:

     3300, 3b1, 3bN, 7300, altos3068, altos, apollo68, att-7300,
     balance, convex-cN, crds, decstation-3100, decstation, delta,
     encore, fx2800, gmicro, hp7NN, hp8NN, hp9k2NN, hp9k3NN, hp9k7NN,
     hp9k8NN, iris4d, iris, isi68, m3230, magnum, merlin, miniframe,
     mmax, news-3600, news800, news, next, pbd, pc532, pmax, powerpc,
     ps2, risc-news, rtpc, sun2, sun386i, sun386, sun3, sun4, symmetry,
     tower-32, tower.

Remember that a machine name specifies both the cpu type and the company
name.  If you want to install your own homemade configuration files,
you can use `local' as the company name to access them.  If you use
configuration `CPU-local', the configuration name without the cpu prefix
is used to form the configuration file names.

   Thus, if you specify `m68k-local', configuration uses files
`m68k.md', `local.h', `m68k.c', `xm-local.h', `t-local', and `x-local',
all in the directory `config/m68k'.

   Here is a list of configurations that have special treatment or
special things you must know:

`1750a-*-*'
     MIL-STD-1750A processors.

     Starting with GCC 2.6.1, the MIL-STD-1750A cross configuration no
     longer supports the Tektronix Assembler, but instead produces
     output for `as1750', an assembler/linker available under the GNU
     Public License for the 1750A. Contact *okellogg@salyko.cube.net*
     for more details on obtaining `as1750'.  A similarly licensed
     simulator for the 1750A is available from same address.

     You should ignore a fatal error during the building of libgcc
     (libgcc is not yet implemented for the 1750A.)

     The `as1750' assembler requires the file `ms1750.inc', which is
     found in the directory `config/1750a'.

     GNU CC produced the same sections as the Fairchild F9450 C
     Compiler, namely:

    `NREL'
          The program code section.

    `SREL'
          The read/write (RAM) data section.

    `KREL'
          The read-only (ROM) constants section.

    `IREL'
          Initialization section (code to copy KREL to SREL).

     The smallest addressable unit is 16 bits (BITS_PER_UNIT is 16).
     This means that type `char' is represented with a 16-bit word per
     character.  The 1750A's "Load/Store Upper/Lower Byte" instructions
     are not used by GNU CC.

     There is a problem with long argument lists to functions.  The
     compiler aborts if the sum of space needed by all arguments
     exceeds 14 words.  This is because the arguments are passed in
     registers (R0..R13) not on the stack, and there is a problem with
     passing further arguments (i.e.  beyond those in R0..R13) via the
     stack.

     If efficiency is less important than using long argument lists, you
     can change the definition of the `FUNCTION_ARG' macro in
     `config/1750/1750a.h' to always return zero.  If you do that, GNU
     CC will pass all parameters on the stack.

`alpha-*-osf1'
     Systems using processors that implement the DEC Alpha architecture
     and are running the OSF/1 operating system, for example the DEC
     Alpha AXP systems.  (VMS on the Alpha is not currently supported
     by GNU CC.)

     GNU CC writes a `.verstamp' directive to the assembler output file
     unless it is built as a cross-compiler.  It gets the version to
     use from the system header file `/usr/include/stamp.h'.  If you
     install a new version of OSF/1, you should rebuild GCC to pick up
     the new version stamp.

     Note that since the Alpha is a 64-bit architecture,
     cross-compilers from 32-bit machines will not generate code as
     efficient as that generated when the compiler is running on a
     64-bit machine because many optimizations that depend on being
     able to represent a word on the target in an integral value on the
     host cannot be performed.  Building cross-compilers on the Alpha
     for 32-bit machines has only been tested in a few cases and may
     not work properly.

     `make compare' may fail on old versions of OSF/1 unless you add
     `-save-temps' to `CFLAGS'.  On these systems, the name of the
     assembler input file is stored in the object file, and that makes
     comparison fail if it differs between the `stage1' and `stage2'
     compilations.  The option `-save-temps' forces a fixed name to be
     used for the assembler input file, instead of a randomly chosen
     name in `/tmp'.  Do not add `-save-temps' unless the comparisons
     fail without that option.  If you add `-save-temps', you will have
     to manually delete the `.i' and `.s' files after each series of
     compilations.

     GNU CC now supports both the native (ECOFF) debugging format used
     by DBX and GDB and an encapsulated STABS format for use only with
     GDB.  See the discussion of the `--with-stabs' option of
     `configure' above for more information on these formats and how to
     select them.

     There is a bug in DEC's assembler that produces incorrect line
     numbers for ECOFF format when the `.align' directive is used.  To
     work around this problem, GNU CC will not emit such alignment
     directives while writing ECOFF format debugging information even
     if optimization is being performed.  Unfortunately, this has the
     very undesirable side-effect that code addresses when `-O' is
     specified are different depending on whether or not `-g' is also
     specified.

     To avoid this behavior, specify `-gstabs+' and use GDB instead of
     DBX.  DEC is now aware of this problem with the assembler and
     hopes to provide a fix shortly.

`arm'
     Advanced RISC Machines ARM-family processors.  These are often
     used in embedded applications.  There are no standard Unix
     configurations.  This configuration corresponds to the basic
     instruction sequences and will produce a.out format object modules.

     You may need to make a variant of the file `arm.h' for your
     particular configuration.

`arm-*-riscix'
     The ARM2 or ARM3 processor running RISC iX, Acorn's port of BSD
     Unix.  If you are running a version of RISC iX prior to 1.2 then
     you must specify the version number during configuration.  Note
     that the assembler shipped with RISC iX does not support stabs
     debugging information; a new version of the assembler, with stabs
     support included, is now available from Acorn.

`a29k'
     AMD Am29k-family processors.  These are normally used in embedded
     applications.  There are no standard Unix configurations.  This
     configuration corresponds to AMD's standard calling sequence and
     binary interface and is compatible with other 29k tools.

     You may need to make a variant of the file `a29k.h' for your
     particular configuration.

`a29k-*-bsd'
     AMD Am29050 used in a system running a variant of BSD Unix.

`decstation-*'
     DECstations can support three different personalities: Ultrix, DEC
     OSF/1, and OSF/rose.  To configure GCC for these platforms use the
     following configurations:

    `decstation-ultrix'
          Ultrix configuration.

    `decstation-osf1'
          Dec's version of OSF/1.

    `decstation-osfrose'
          Open Software Foundation reference port of OSF/1 which uses
          the OSF/rose object file format instead of ECOFF.  Normally,
          you would not select this configuration.

     The MIPS C compiler needs to be told to increase its table size
     for switch statements with the `-Wf,-XNg1500' option in order to
     compile `cp/parse.c'.  If you use the `-O2' optimization option,
     you also need to use `-Olimit 3000'.  Both of these options are
     automatically generated in the `Makefile' that the shell script
     `configure' builds.  If you override the `CC' make variable and
     use the MIPS compilers, you may need to add `-Wf,-XNg1500 -Olimit
     3000'.

`elxsi-elxsi-bsd'
     The Elxsi's C compiler has known limitations that prevent it from
     compiling GNU C.  Please contact `mrs@cygnus.com' for more details.

`dsp16xx'
     A port to the AT&T DSP1610 family of processors.

`h8300-*-*'
     The calling convention and structure layout has changed in release
     2.6.  All code must be recompiled.  The calling convention now
     passes the first three arguments in function calls in registers.
     Structures are no longer a multiple of 2 bytes.

`hppa*-*-*'
     There are two variants of this CPU, called 1.0 and 1.1, which have
     different machine descriptions.  You must use the right one for
     your machine.  All 7NN machines and 8N7 machines use 1.1, while
     all other 8NN machines use 1.0.

     The easiest way to handle this problem is to use `configure hpNNN'
     or `configure hpNNN-hpux', where NNN is the model number of the
     machine.  Then `configure' will figure out if the machine is a 1.0
     or 1.1.  Use `uname -a' to find out the model number of your
     machine.

     `-g' does not work on HP-UX, since that system uses a peculiar
     debugging format which GNU CC does not know about.  However, `-g'
     will work if you also use GAS and GDB in conjunction with GCC.  We
     highly recommend using GAS for all HP-PA configurations.

     You should be using GAS-2.3 (or later) along with GDB-4.12 (or
     later).  These can be retrieved from all the traditional GNU ftp
     archive sites.

     Build GAS and install the resulting binary as:

          /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/CONFIGURATION/GCCVERSION/as

     where CONFIGURATION is the configuration name (perhaps
     `hpNNN-hpux') and GCCVERSION is the GNU CC version number.  Do
     this *before* starting the build process, otherwise you will get
     errors from the HPUX assembler while building `libgcc2.a'.  The
     command

          make install-dir

     will create the necessary directory hierarchy so you can install
     GAS before building GCC.

     To enable debugging, configure GNU CC with the `--with-gnu-as'
     option before building.

     It has been reported that GNU CC produces invalid assembly code for
     1.1 machines running HP-UX 8.02 when using the HP assembler.
     Typically the errors look like this:
          as: bug.s @line#15 [err#1060]
            Argument 0 or 2 in FARG upper
                   - lookahead = ARGW1=FR,RTNVAL=GR
          as: foo.s @line#28 [err#1060]
            Argument 0 or 2 in FARG upper
                   - lookahead = ARGW1=FR

     You can check the version of HP-UX you are running by executing
     the command `uname -r'.   If you are indeed running HP-UX 8.02 on
     a PA and using the HP assembler then configure GCC with
     "hpNNN-hpux8.02".

`i370-*-*'
     This port is very preliminary and has many known bugs.  We hope to
     have a higher-quality port for this machine soon.

`i386-*-gnu/linux'
     Bash-1.12 has a bug that causes configure to fail.  The symptom is
     that the c++ subdirectory, `cp', is not configured.  Bash-1.14 and
     later work fine.

`i386-*-sco'
     Compilation with RCC is recommended.  Also, it may be a good idea
     to link with GNU malloc instead of the malloc that comes with the
     system.

`i386-*-sco3.2.4'
     Use this configuration for SCO release 3.2 version 4.

`i386-*-isc'
     It may be a good idea to link with GNU malloc instead of the
     malloc that comes with the system.

     In ISC version 4.1, `sed' core dumps when building `deduced.h'.
     Use the version of `sed' from version 4.0.

`i386-*-esix'
     It may be good idea to link with GNU malloc instead of the malloc
     that comes with the system.

`i386-ibm-aix'
     You need to use GAS version 2.1 or later, and and LD from GNU
     binutils version 2.2 or later.

`i386-sequent-bsd'
     Go to the Berkeley universe before compiling.  In addition, you
     probably need to create a file named `string.h' containing just
     one line: `#include <strings.h>'.

`i386-sequent-ptx1*'
     Sequent DYNIX/ptx 1.x.

`i386-sequent-ptx2*'
     Sequent DYNIX/ptx 2.x.

`i386-sun-sunos4'
     You may find that you need another version of GNU CC to begin
     bootstrapping with, since the current version when built with the
     system's own compiler seems to get an infinite loop compiling part
     of `libgcc2.c'.  GNU CC version 2 compiled with GNU CC (any
     version) seems not to have this problem.

     See *Note Sun Install::, for information on installing GNU CC on
     Sun systems.

`i860-intel-osf1'
     This is the Paragon.  If you have version 1.0 of the operating
     system, see *Note Installation Problems::, for special things you
     need to do to compensate for peculiarities in the system.

`m68000-hp-bsd'
     HP 9000 series 200 running BSD.  Note that the C compiler that
     comes with this system cannot compile GNU CC; contact
     `law@cs.utah.edu' to get binaries of GNU CC for bootstrapping.

`m68k-altos'
     Altos 3068.  You must use the GNU assembler, linker and debugger.
     Also, you must fix a kernel bug.  Details in the file
     `README.ALTOS'.

`m68k-att-sysv'
     AT&T 3b1, a.k.a. 7300 PC.  Special procedures are needed to
     compile GNU CC with this machine's standard C compiler, due to
     bugs in that compiler.  You can bootstrap it more easily with
     previous versions of GNU CC if you have them.

     Installing GNU CC on the 3b1 is difficult if you do not already
     have GNU CC running, due to bugs in the installed C compiler.
     However, the following procedure might work.  We are unable to
     test it.

       1. Comment out the `#include "config.h"' line on line 37 of
          `cccp.c' and do `make cpp'.  This makes a preliminary version
          of GNU cpp.

       2. Save the old `/lib/cpp' and copy the preliminary GNU cpp to
          that file name.

       3. Undo your change in `cccp.c', or reinstall the original
          version, and do `make cpp' again.

       4. Copy this final version of GNU cpp into `/lib/cpp'.

       5. Replace every occurrence of `obstack_free' in the file
          `tree.c' with `_obstack_free'.

       6. Run `make' to get the first-stage GNU CC.

       7. Reinstall the original version of `/lib/cpp'.

       8. Now you can compile GNU CC with itself and install it in the
          normal fashion.

`m68k-bull-sysv'
     Bull DPX/2 series 200 and 300 with BOS-2.00.45 up to BOS-2.01. GNU
     CC works either with native assembler or GNU assembler. You can use
     GNU assembler with native coff generation by providing
     `--with-gnu-as' to the configure script or use GNU assembler with
     dbx-in-coff encapsulation by providing `--with-gnu-as --stabs'.
     For any problem with native assembler or for availability of the
     DPX/2 port of GAS, contact `F.Pierresteguy@frcl.bull.fr'.

`m68k-crds-unox'
     Use `configure unos' for building on Unos.

     The Unos assembler is named `casm' instead of `as'.  For some
     strange reason linking `/bin/as' to `/bin/casm' changes the
     behavior, and does not work.  So, when installing GNU CC, you
     should install the following script as `as' in the subdirectory
     where the passes of GCC are installed:

          #!/bin/sh
          casm $*

     The default Unos library is named `libunos.a' instead of `libc.a'.
     To allow GNU CC to function, either change all references to
     `-lc' in `gcc.c' to `-lunos' or link `/lib/libc.a' to
     `/lib/libunos.a'.

     When compiling GNU CC with the standard compiler, to overcome bugs
     in the support of `alloca', do not use `-O' when making stage 2.
     Then use the stage 2 compiler with `-O' to make the stage 3
     compiler.  This compiler will have the same characteristics as the
     usual stage 2 compiler on other systems.  Use it to make a stage 4
     compiler and compare that with stage 3 to verify proper
     compilation.

     (Perhaps simply defining `ALLOCA' in `x-crds' as described in the
     comments there will make the above paragraph superfluous.  Please
     inform us of whether this works.)

     Unos uses memory segmentation instead of demand paging, so you
     will need a lot of memory.  5 Mb is barely enough if no other
     tasks are running.  If linking `cc1' fails, try putting the object
     files into a library and linking from that library.

`m68k-hp-hpux'
     HP 9000 series 300 or 400 running HP-UX.  HP-UX version 8.0 has a
     bug in the assembler that prevents compilation of GNU CC.  To fix
     it, get patch PHCO_4484 from HP.

     In addition, if you wish to use gas `--with-gnu-as' you must use
     gas version 2.1 or later, and you must use the GNU linker version
     2.1 or later.  Earlier versions of gas relied upon a program which
     converted the gas output into the native HP/UX format, but that
     program has not been kept up to date.  gdb does not understand
     that native HP/UX format, so you must use gas if you wish to use
     gdb.

`m68k-sun'
     Sun 3.  We do not provide a configuration file to use the Sun FPA
     by default, because programs that establish signal handlers for
     floating point traps inherently cannot work with the FPA.

     See *Note Sun Install::, for information on installing GNU CC on
     Sun systems.

`m88k-*-svr3'
     Motorola m88k running the AT&T/Unisoft/Motorola V.3 reference port.
     These systems tend to use the Green Hills C, revision 1.8.5, as the
     standard C compiler.  There are apparently bugs in this compiler
     that result in object files differences between stage 2 and stage
     3.  If this happens, make the stage 4 compiler and compare it to
     the stage 3 compiler.  If the stage 3 and stage 4 object files are
     identical, this suggests you encountered a problem with the
     standard C compiler; the stage 3 and 4 compilers may be usable.

     It is best, however, to use an older version of GNU CC for
     bootstrapping if you have one.

`m88k-*-dgux'
     Motorola m88k running DG/UX.  To build 88open BCS native or cross
     compilers on DG/UX, specify the configuration name as
     `m88k-*-dguxbcs' and build in the 88open BCS software development
     environment.  To build ELF native or cross compilers on DG/UX,
     specify `m88k-*-dgux' and build in the DG/UX ELF development
     environment.  You set the software development environment by
     issuing `sde-target' command and specifying either `m88kbcs' or
     `m88kdguxelf' as the operand.

     If you do not specify a configuration name, `configure' guesses the
     configuration based on the current software development
     environment.

`m88k-tektronix-sysv3'
     Tektronix XD88 running UTekV 3.2e.  Do not turn on optimization
     while building stage1 if you bootstrap with the buggy Green Hills
     compiler.  Also, The bundled LAI System V NFS is buggy so if you
     build in an NFS mounted directory, start from a fresh reboot, or
     avoid NFS all together.  Otherwise you may have trouble getting
     clean comparisons between stages.

`mips-mips-bsd'
     MIPS machines running the MIPS operating system in BSD mode.  It's
     possible that some old versions of the system lack the functions
     `memcpy', `memcmp', and `memset'.  If your system lacks these, you
     must remove or undo the definition of `TARGET_MEM_FUNCTIONS' in
     `mips-bsd.h'.

     The MIPS C compiler needs to be told to increase its table size
     for switch statements with the `-Wf,-XNg1500' option in order to
     compile `cp/parse.c'.  If you use the `-O2' optimization option,
     you also need to use `-Olimit 3000'.  Both of these options are
     automatically generated in the `Makefile' that the shell script
     `configure' builds.  If you override the `CC' make variable and
     use the MIPS compilers, you may need to add `-Wf,-XNg1500 -Olimit
     3000'.

`mips-mips-riscos*'
     The MIPS C compiler needs to be told to increase its table size
     for switch statements with the `-Wf,-XNg1500' option in order to
     compile `cp/parse.c'.  If you use the `-O2' optimization option,
     you also need to use `-Olimit 3000'.  Both of these options are
     automatically generated in the `Makefile' that the shell script
     `configure' builds.  If you override the `CC' make variable and
     use the MIPS compilers, you may need to add `-Wf,-XNg1500 -Olimit
     3000'.

     MIPS computers running RISC-OS can support four different
     personalities: default, BSD 4.3, System V.3, and System V.4 (older
     versions of RISC-OS don't support V.4).  To configure GCC for
     these platforms use the following configurations:

    `mips-mips-riscos`rev''
          Default configuration for RISC-OS, revision `rev'.

    `mips-mips-riscos`rev'bsd'
          BSD 4.3 configuration for RISC-OS, revision `rev'.

    `mips-mips-riscos`rev'sysv4'
          System V.4 configuration for RISC-OS, revision `rev'.

    `mips-mips-riscos`rev'sysv'
          System V.3 configuration for RISC-OS, revision `rev'.

     The revision `rev' mentioned above is the revision of RISC-OS to
     use.  You must reconfigure GCC when going from a RISC-OS revision
     4 to RISC-OS revision 5.  This has the effect of avoiding a linker
     bug (see *Note Installation Problems::, for more details).

`mips-sgi-*'
     In order to compile GCC on an SGI running IRIX 4, the "c.hdr.lib"
     option must be installed from the CD-ROM supplied from Silicon
     Graphics.  This is found on the 2nd CD in release 4.0.1.

     `make compare' may fail on version 5 of IRIX unless you add
     `-save-temps' to `CFLAGS'.  On these systems, the name of the
     assembler input file is stored in the object file, and that makes
     comparison fail if it differs between the `stage1' and `stage2'
     compilations.  The option `-save-temps' forces a fixed name to be
     used for the assembler input file, instead of a randomly chosen
     name in `/tmp'.  Do not add `-save-temps' unless the comparisons
     fail without that option.  If you do you `-save-temps', you will
     have to manually delete the `.i' and `.s' files after each series
     of compilations.

     The MIPS C compiler needs to be told to increase its table size
     for switch statements with the `-Wf,-XNg1500' option in order to
     compile `cp/parse.c'.  If you use the `-O2' optimization option,
     you also need to use `-Olimit 3000'.  Both of these options are
     automatically generated in the `Makefile' that the shell script
     `configure' builds.  If you override the `CC' make variable and
     use the MIPS compilers, you may need to add `-Wf,-XNg1500 -Olimit
     3000'.

     On Irix version 4.0.5F, and perhaps on some other versions as well,
     there is an assembler bug that reorders instructions incorrectly.
     To work around it, specify the target configuration
     `mips-sgi-irix4loser'.  This configuration inhibits assembler
     optimization.

     In a compiler configured with target `mips-sgi-irix4', you can turn
     off assembler optimization by using the `-noasmopt' option.  This
     compiler option passes the option `-O0' to the assembler, to
     inhibit reordering.

     The `-noasmopt' option can be useful for testing whether a problem
     is due to erroneous assembler reordering.  Even if a problem does
     not go away with `-noasmopt', it may still be due to assembler
     reordering--perhaps GNU CC itself was miscompiled as a result.

     To enable debugging under Irix 5, you must use GNU as 2.5 or later,
     and use the -with-gnu-as configure option when configuring gcc.
     GNU as is distributed as part of the binutils package.

`mips-sony-sysv'
     Sony MIPS NEWS.  This works in NEWSOS 5.0.1, but not in 5.0.2
     (which uses ELF instead of COFF).  Support for 5.0.2 will probably
     be provided soon by volunteers.  In particular, the linker does
     not like the code generated by GCC when shared libraries are
     linked in.

`ns32k-encore'
     Encore ns32000 system.  Encore systems are supported only under
     BSD.

`ns32k-*-genix'
     National Semiconductor ns32000 system.  Genix has bugs in `alloca'
     and `malloc'; you must get the compiled versions of these from GNU
     Emacs.

`ns32k-sequent'
     Go to the Berkeley universe before compiling.  In addition, you
     probably need to create a file named `string.h' containing just
     one line: `#include <strings.h>'.

`ns32k-utek'
     UTEK ns32000 system ("merlin").  The C compiler that comes with
     this system cannot compile GNU CC; contact `tektronix!reed!mason'
     to get binaries of GNU CC for bootstrapping.

`romp-*-aos'
`romp-*-mach'
     The only operating systems supported for the IBM RT PC are AOS and
     MACH.  GNU CC does not support AIX running on the RT.  We
     recommend you compile GNU CC with an earlier version of itself; if
     you compile GNU CC with `hc', the Metaware compiler, it will work,
     but you will get mismatches between the stage 2 and stage 3
     compilers in various files.  These errors are minor differences in
     some floating-point constants and can be safely ignored; the stage
     3 compiler is correct.

`rs6000-*-aix'
`powerpc-*-aix'
     Various early versions of each release of the IBM XLC compiler
     will not bootstrap GNU CC.  Symptoms include differences between
     the stage2 and stage3 object files, and errors when compiling
     `libgcc.a' or `enquire'.  Known problematic releases include:
     xlc-1.2.1.8, xlc-1.3.0.0 (distributed with AIX 3.2.5), and
     xlc-1.3.0.19.  Both xlc-1.2.1.28 and xlc-1.3.0.24 (PTF 432238) are
     known to produce working versions of GNU CC, but most other recent
     releases correctly bootstrap GNU CC.  Also, releases of AIX prior
     to AIX 3.2.4 include a version of the IBM assembler which does not
     accept debugging directives: assembler updates are available as
     PTFs.  See the file `README.RS6000' for more details on both of
     these problems.  Only AIX is supported on the PowerPC.  GNU CC
     does not yet support the 64-bit PowerPC instructions.

     Objective C does not work on this architecture.

     AIX on the RS/6000 provides support (NLS) for environments outside
     of the United States.  Compilers and assemblers use NLS to support
     locale-specific representations of various objects including
     floating-point numbers ("." vs "," for separating decimal
     fractions).  There have been problems reported where the library
     linked with GNU CC does not produce the same floating-point
     formats that the assembler accepts.  If you have this problem, set
     the LANG environment variable to "C" or "En_US".

`vax-dec-ultrix'
     Don't try compiling with Vax C (`vcc').  It produces incorrect code
     in some cases (for example, when `alloca' is used).

     Meanwhile, compiling `cp/parse.c' with pcc does not work because of
     an internal table size limitation in that compiler.  To avoid this
     problem, compile just the GNU C compiler first, and use it to
     recompile building all the languages that you want to run.

`sparc-sun-*'
     See *Note Sun Install::, for information on installing GNU CC on
     Sun systems.

`vax-dec-vms'
     See *Note VMS Install::, for details on how to install GNU CC on
     VMS.

`we32k-*-*'
     These computers are also known as the 3b2, 3b5, 3b20 and other
     similar names.  (However, the 3b1 is actually a 68000; see *Note
     Configurations::.)

     Don't use `-g' when compiling with the system's compiler.  The
     system's linker seems to be unable to handle such a large program
     with debugging information.

     The system's compiler runs out of capacity when compiling `stmt.c'
     in GNU CC.  You can work around this by building `cpp' in GNU CC
     first, then use that instead of the system's preprocessor with the
     system's C compiler to compile `stmt.c'.  Here is how:

          mv /lib/cpp /lib/cpp.att
          cp cpp /lib/cpp.gnu
          echo '/lib/cpp.gnu -traditional ${1+"$@"}' > /lib/cpp
          chmod +x /lib/cpp

     The system's compiler produces bad code for some of the GNU CC
     optimization files.  So you must build the stage 2 compiler without
     optimization.  Then build a stage 3 compiler with optimization.
     That executable should work.  Here are the necessary commands:

          make LANGUAGES=c CC=stage1/xgcc CFLAGS="-Bstage1/ -g"
          make stage2
          make CC=stage2/xgcc CFLAGS="-Bstage2/ -g -O"

     You may need to raise the ULIMIT setting to build a C++ compiler,
     as the file `cc1plus' is larger than one megabyte.



Compilation in a Separate Directory
===================================

   If you wish to build the object files and executables in a directory
other than the one containing the source files, here is what you must
do differently:

  1. Make sure you have a version of Make that supports the `VPATH'
     feature.  (GNU Make supports it, as do Make versions on most BSD
     systems.)

  2. If you have ever run `configure' in the source directory, you must
     undo the configuration.  Do this by running:

          make distclean

  3. Go to the directory in which you want to build the compiler before
     running `configure':

          mkdir gcc-sun3
          cd gcc-sun3

     On systems that do not support symbolic links, this directory must
     be on the same file system as the source code directory.

  4. Specify where to find `configure' when you run it:

          ../gcc/configure ...

     This also tells `configure' where to find the compiler sources;
     `configure' takes the directory from the file name that was used to
     invoke it.  But if you want to be sure, you can specify the source
     directory with the `--srcdir' option, like this:

          ../gcc/configure --srcdir=../gcc OTHER OPTIONS

     The directory you specify with `--srcdir' need not be the same as
     the one that `configure' is found in.

   Now, you can run `make' in that directory.  You need not repeat the
configuration steps shown above, when ordinary source files change.  You
must, however, run `configure' again when the configuration files
change, if your system does not support symbolic links.



Building and Installing a Cross-Compiler
========================================

   GNU CC can function as a cross-compiler for many machines, but not
all.

   * Cross-compilers for the Mips as target using the Mips assembler
     currently do not work, because the auxiliary programs
     `mips-tdump.c' and `mips-tfile.c' can't be compiled on anything
     but a Mips.  It does work to cross compile for a Mips if you use
     the GNU assembler and linker.

   * Cross-compilers between machines with different floating point
     formats have not all been made to work.  GNU CC now has a floating
     point emulator with which these can work, but each target machine
     description needs to be updated to take advantage of it.

   * Cross-compilation between machines of different word sizes is
     somewhat problematic and sometimes does not work.

   Since GNU CC generates assembler code, you probably need a
cross-assembler that GNU CC can run, in order to produce object files.
If you want to link on other than the target machine, you need a
cross-linker as well.  You also need header files and libraries suitable
for the target machine that you can install on the host machine.


Steps of Cross-Compilation
--------------------------

   To compile and run a program using a cross-compiler involves several
steps:

   * Run the cross-compiler on the host machine to produce assembler
     files for the target machine.  This requires header files for the
     target machine.

   * Assemble the files produced by the cross-compiler.  You can do this
     either with an assembler on the target machine, or with a
     cross-assembler on the host machine.

   * Link those files to make an executable.  You can do this either
     with a linker on the target machine, or with a cross-linker on the
     host machine.  Whichever machine you use, you need libraries and
     certain startup files (typically `crt....o') for the target
     machine.

   It is most convenient to do all of these steps on the same host
machine, since then you can do it all with a single invocation of GNU
CC.  This requires a suitable cross-assembler and cross-linker.  For
some targets, the GNU assembler and linker are available.




Configuring a Cross-Compiler
----------------------------

   To build GNU CC as a cross-compiler, you start out by running
`configure'.  Use the `--target=TARGET' to specify the target type.  If
`configure' was unable to correctly identify the system you are running
on, also specify the `--build=BUILD' option.  For example, here is how
to configure for a cross-compiler that produces code for an HP 68030
system running BSD on a system that `configure' can correctly identify:

     ./configure --target=m68k-hp-bsd4.3




Tools and Libraries for a Cross-Compiler
----------------------------------------

   If you have a cross-assembler and cross-linker available, you should
install them now.  Put them in the directory `/usr/local/TARGET/bin'.
Here is a table of the tools you should put in this directory:

`as'
     This should be the cross-assembler.

`ld'
     This should be the cross-linker.

`ar'
     This should be the cross-archiver: a program which can manipulate
     archive files (linker libraries) in the target machine's format.

`ranlib'
     This should be a program to construct a symbol table in an archive
     file.

   The installation of GNU CC will find these programs in that
directory, and copy or link them to the proper place to for the
cross-compiler to find them when run later.

   The easiest way to provide these files is to build the Binutils
package and GAS.  Configure them with the same `--host' and `--target'
options that you use for configuring GNU CC, then build and install
them.  They install their executables automatically into the proper
directory.  Alas, they do not support all the targets that GNU CC
supports.

   If you want to install libraries to use with the cross-compiler,
such as a standard C library, put them in the directory
`/usr/local/TARGET/lib'; installation of GNU CC copies all all the
files in that subdirectory into the proper place for GNU CC to find
them and link with them.  Here's an example of copying some libraries
from a target machine:

     ftp TARGET-MACHINE
     lcd /usr/local/TARGET/lib
     cd /lib
     get libc.a
     cd /usr/lib
     get libg.a
     get libm.a
     quit

The precise set of libraries you'll need, and their locations on the
target machine, vary depending on its operating system.

   Many targets require "start files" such as `crt0.o' and `crtn.o'
which are linked into each executable; these too should be placed in
`/usr/local/TARGET/lib'.  There may be several alternatives for
`crt0.o', for use with profiling or other compilation options.  Check
your target's definition of `STARTFILE_SPEC' to find out what start
files it uses.  Here's an example of copying these files from a target
machine:

     ftp TARGET-MACHINE
     lcd /usr/local/TARGET/lib
     prompt
     cd /lib
     mget *crt*.o
     cd /usr/lib
     mget *crt*.o
     quit




`libgcc.a' and Cross-Compilers
------------------------------

   Code compiled by GNU CC uses certain runtime support functions
implicitly.  Some of these functions can be compiled successfully with
GNU CC itself, but a few cannot be.  These problem functions are in the
source file `libgcc1.c'; the library made from them is called
`libgcc1.a'.

   When you build a native compiler, these functions are compiled with
some other compiler-the one that you use for bootstrapping GNU CC.
Presumably it knows how to open code these operations, or else knows how
to call the run-time emulation facilities that the machine comes with.
But this approach doesn't work for building a cross-compiler.  The
compiler that you use for building knows about the host system, not the
target system.

   So, when you build a cross-compiler you have to supply a suitable
library `libgcc1.a' that does the job it is expected to do.

   To compile `libgcc1.c' with the cross-compiler itself does not work.
The functions in this file are supposed to implement arithmetic
operations that GNU CC does not know how to open code, for your target
machine.  If these functions are compiled with GNU CC itself, they will
compile into infinite recursion.

   On any given target, most of these functions are not needed.  If GNU
CC can open code an arithmetic operation, it will not call these
functions to perform the operation.  It is possible that on your target
machine, none of these functions is needed.  If so, you can supply an
empty library as `libgcc1.a'.

   Many targets need library support only for multiplication and
division.  If you are linking with a library that contains functions for
multiplication and division, you can tell GNU CC to call them directly
by defining the macros `MULSI3_LIBCALL', and the like.  These macros
need to be defined in the target description macro file.  For some
targets, they are defined already.  This may be sufficient to avoid the
need for libgcc1.a; if so, you can supply an empty library.

   Some targets do not have floating point instructions; they need other
functions in `libgcc1.a', which do floating arithmetic.  Recent
versions of GNU CC have a file which emulates floating point.  With a
certain amount of work, you should be able to construct a floating
point emulator that can be used as `libgcc1.a'.  Perhaps future
versions will contain code to do this automatically and conveniently.
That depends on whether someone wants to implement it.

   If your target system has another C compiler, you can configure GNU
CC as a native compiler on that machine, build just `libgcc1.a' with
`make libgcc1.a' on that machine, and use the resulting file with the
cross-compiler.  To do this, execute the following on the target
machine:

     cd TARGET-BUILD-DIR
     ./configure --host=sparc --target=sun3
     make libgcc1.a

And then this on the host machine:

     ftp TARGET-MACHINE
     binary
     cd TARGET-BUILD-DIR
     get libgcc1.a
     quit

   Another way to provide the functions you need in `libgcc1.a' is to
define the appropriate `perform_...' macros for those functions.  If
these definitions do not use the C arithmetic operators that they are
meant to implement, you should be able to compile them with the
cross-compiler you are building.  (If these definitions already exist
for your target file, then you are all set.)

   To build `libgcc1.a' using the perform macros, use
`LIBGCC1=libgcc1.a OLDCC=./xgcc' when building the compiler.
Otherwise, you should place your replacement library under the name
`libgcc1.a' in the directory in which you will build the
cross-compiler, before you run `make'.




Cross-Compilers and Header Files
--------------------------------

   If you are cross-compiling a standalone program or a program for an
embedded system, then you may not need any header files except the few
that are part of GNU CC (and those of your program).  However, if you
intend to link your program with a standard C library such as `libc.a',
then you probably need to compile with the header files that go with
the library you use.

   The GNU C compiler does not come with these files, because (1) they
are system-specific, and (2) they belong in a C library, not in a
compiler.

   If the GNU C library supports your target machine, then you can get
the header files from there (assuming you actually use the GNU library
when you link your program).

   If your target machine comes with a C compiler, it probably comes
with suitable header files also.  If you make these files accessible
from the host machine, the cross-compiler can use them also.

   Otherwise, you're on your own in finding header files to use when
cross-compiling.

   When you have found suitable header files, put them in
`/usr/local/TARGET/include', before building the cross compiler.  Then
installation will run fixincludes properly and install the corrected
versions of the header files where the compiler will use them.

   Provide the header files before you build the cross-compiler, because
the build stage actually runs the cross-compiler to produce parts of
`libgcc.a'.  (These are the parts that *can* be compiled with GNU CC.)
Some of them need suitable header files.

   Here's an example showing how to copy the header files from a target
machine.  On the target machine, do this:

     (cd /usr/include; tar cf - .) > tarfile

   Then, on the host machine, do this:

     ftp TARGET-MACHINE
     lcd /usr/local/TARGET/include
     get tarfile
     quit
     tar xf tarfile




Actually Building the Cross-Compiler
------------------------------------

   Now you can proceed just as for compiling a single-machine compiler
through the step of building stage 1.  If you have not provided some
sort of `libgcc1.a', then compilation will give up at the point where
it needs that file, printing a suitable error message.  If you do
provide `libgcc1.a', then building the compiler will automatically
compile and link a test program called `cross-test'; if you get errors
in the linking, it means that not all of the necessary routines in
`libgcc1.a' are available.

   If you are making a cross-compiler for an embedded system, and there
is no `stdio.h' header for it, then the compilation of `enquire' will
probably fail.  The job of `enquire' is to run on the target machine
and figure out by experiment the nature of its floating point
representation.  `enquire' records its findings in the header file
`float.h'.  If you can't produce this file by running `enquire' on the
target machine, then you will need to come up with a suitable `float.h'
in some other way (or else, avoid using it in your programs).

   Do not try to build stage 2 for a cross-compiler.  It doesn't work to
rebuild GNU CC as a cross-compiler using the cross-compiler, because
that would produce a program that runs on the target machine, not on the
host.  For example, if you compile a 386-to-68030 cross-compiler with
itself, the result will not be right either for the 386 (because it was
compiled into 68030 code) or for the 68030 (because it was configured
for a 386 as the host).  If you want to compile GNU CC into 68030 code,
whether you compile it on a 68030 or with a cross-compiler on a 386, you
must specify a 68030 as the host when you configure it.

   To install the cross-compiler, use `make install', as usual.




Installing GNU CC on the Sun
============================

   On Solaris (version 2.1), do not use the linker or other tools in
`/usr/ucb' to build GNU CC.  Use `/usr/ccs/bin'.

   Make sure the environment variable `FLOAT_OPTION' is not set when
you compile `libgcc.a'.  If this option were set to `f68881' when
`libgcc.a' is compiled, the resulting code would demand to be linked
with a special startup file and would not link properly without special
pains.

   There is a bug in `alloca' in certain versions of the Sun library.
To avoid this bug, install the binaries of GNU CC that were compiled by
GNU CC.  They use `alloca' as a built-in function and never the one in
the library.

   Some versions of the Sun compiler crash when compiling GNU CC.  The
problem is a segmentation fault in cpp.  This problem seems to be due to
the bulk of data in the environment variables.  You may be able to avoid
it by using the following command to compile GNU CC with Sun CC:

     make CC="TERMCAP=x OBJS=x LIBFUNCS=x STAGESTUFF=x cc"


Installing GNU CC on VMS
========================

   The VMS version of GNU CC is distributed in a backup saveset
containing both source code and precompiled binaries.

   To install the `gcc' command so you can use the compiler easily, in
the same manner as you use the VMS C compiler, you must install the VMS
CLD file for GNU CC as follows:

  1. Define the VMS logical names `GNU_CC' and `GNU_CC_INCLUDE' to
     point to the directories where the GNU CC executables
     (`gcc-cpp.exe', `gcc-cc1.exe', etc.) and the C include files are
     kept respectively.  This should be done with the commands:

          $ assign /system /translation=concealed -
            disk:[gcc.] gnu_cc
          $ assign /system /translation=concealed -
            disk:[gcc.include.] gnu_cc_include

     with the appropriate disk and directory names.  These commands can
     be placed in your system startup file so they will be executed
     whenever the machine is rebooted.  You may, if you choose, do this
     via the `GCC_INSTALL.COM' script in the `[GCC]' directory.

  2. Install the `GCC' command with the command line:

          $ set command /table=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
            /output=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables gnu_cc:[000000]gcc
          $ install replace sys$common:[syslib]dcltables

  3. To install the help file, do the following:

          $ library/help sys$library:helplib.hlb gcc.hlp

     Now you can invoke the compiler with a command like `gcc /verbose
     file.c', which is equivalent to the command `gcc -v -c file.c' in
     Unix.

   If you wish to use GNU C++ you must first install GNU CC, and then
perform the following steps:

  1. Define the VMS logical name `GNU_GXX_INCLUDE' to point to the
     directory where the preprocessor will search for the C++ header
     files.  This can be done with the command:

          $ assign /system /translation=concealed -
            disk:[gcc.gxx_include.] gnu_gxx_include

     with the appropriate disk and directory name.  If you are going to
     be using libg++, this is where the libg++ install procedure will
     install the libg++ header files.

  2. Obtain the file `gcc-cc1plus.exe', and place this in the same
     directory that `gcc-cc1.exe' is kept.

     The GNU C++ compiler can be invoked with a command like `gcc /plus
     /verbose file.cc', which is equivalent to the command `g++ -v -c
     file.cc' in Unix.

   We try to put corresponding binaries and sources on the VMS
distribution tape.  But sometimes the binaries will be from an older
version than the sources, because we don't always have time to update
them.  (Use the `/version' option to determine the version number of
the binaries and compare it with the source file `version.c' to tell
whether this is so.)  In this case, you should use the binaries you get
to recompile the sources.  If you must recompile, here is how:

  1. Execute the command procedure `vmsconfig.com' to set up the files
     `tm.h', `config.h', `aux-output.c', and `md.', and to create files
     `tconfig.h' and `hconfig.h'.  This procedure also creates several
     linker option files used by `make-cc1.com' and a data file used by
     `make-l2.com'.

          $ @vmsconfig.com

  2. Setup the logical names and command tables as defined above.  In
     addition, define the VMS logical name `GNU_BISON' to point at the
     to the directories where the Bison executable is kept.  This
     should be done with the command:

          $ assign /system /translation=concealed -
            disk:[bison.] gnu_bison

     You may, if you choose, use the `INSTALL_BISON.COM' script in the
     `[BISON]' directory.

  3. Install the `BISON' command with the command line:

          $ set command /table=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
            /output=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
            gnu_bison:[000000]bison
          $ install replace sys$common:[syslib]dcltables

  4. Type `@make-gcc' to recompile everything (alternatively, submit
     the file `make-gcc.com' to a batch queue).  If you wish to build
     the GNU C++ compiler as well as the GNU CC compiler, you must
     first edit `make-gcc.com' and follow the instructions that appear
     in the comments.

  5. In order to use GCC, you need a library of functions which GCC
     compiled code will call to perform certain tasks, and these
     functions are defined in the file `libgcc2.c'.  To compile this
     you should use the command procedure `make-l2.com', which will
     generate the library `libgcc2.olb'.  `libgcc2.olb' should be built
     using the compiler built from the same distribution that
     `libgcc2.c' came from, and `make-gcc.com' will automatically do
     all of this for you.

     To install the library, use the following commands:

          $ library gnu_cc:[000000]gcclib/delete=(new,eprintf)
          $ library gnu_cc:[000000]gcclib/delete=L_*
          $ library libgcc2/extract=*/output=libgcc2.obj
          $ library gnu_cc:[000000]gcclib libgcc2.obj

     The first command simply removes old modules that will be replaced
     with modules from `libgcc2' under different module names.  The
     modules `new' and `eprintf' may not actually be present in your
     `gcclib.olb'--if the VMS librarian complains about those modules
     not being present, simply ignore the message and continue on with
     the next command.  The second command removes the modules that
     came from the previous version of the library `libgcc2.c'.

     Whenever you update the compiler on your system, you should also
     update the library with the above procedure.

  6. You may wish to build GCC in such a way that no files are written
     to the directory where the source files reside.  An example would
     be the when the source files are on a read-only disk.  In these
     cases, execute the following DCL commands (substituting your
     actual path names):

          $ assign dua0:[gcc.build_dir.]/translation=concealed, -
                   dua1:[gcc.source_dir.]/translation=concealed
gcc_build
          $ set default gcc_build:[000000]

     where the directory `dua1:[gcc.source_dir]' contains the source
     code, and the directory `dua0:[gcc.build_dir]' is meant to contain
     all of the generated object files and executables.  Once you have
     done this, you can proceed building GCC as described above.  (Keep
     in mind that `gcc_build' is a rooted logical name, and thus the
     device names in each element of the search list must be an actual
     physical device name rather than another rooted logical name).

  7. *If you are building GNU CC with a previous version of GNU CC, you
     also should check to see that you have the newest version of the
     assembler*.  In particular, GNU CC version 2 treats global constant
     variables slightly differently from GNU CC version 1, and GAS
     version 1.38.1 does not have the patches required to work with GCC
     version 2.  If you use GAS 1.38.1, then `extern const' variables
     will not have the read-only bit set, and the linker will generate
     warning messages about mismatched psect attributes for these
     variables.  These warning messages are merely a nuisance, and can
     safely be ignored.

     If you are compiling with a version of GNU CC older than 1.33,
     specify `/DEFINE=("inline=")' as an option in all the
     compilations.  This requires editing all the `gcc' commands in
     `make-cc1.com'.  (The older versions had problems supporting
     `inline'.)  Once you have a working 1.33 or newer GNU CC, you can
     change this file back.

  8. If you want to build GNU CC with the VAX C compiler, you will need
     to make minor changes in `make-cccp.com' and `make-cc1.com' to
     choose alternate definitions of `CC', `CFLAGS', and `LIBS'.  See
     comments in those files.  However, you must also have a working
     version of the GNU assembler (GNU as, aka GAS) as it is used as
     the back-end for GNU CC to produce binary object modules and is
     not included in the GNU CC sources.  GAS is also needed to compile
     `libgcc2' in order to build `gcclib' (see above); `make-l2.com'
     expects to be able to find it operational in
     `gnu_cc:[000000]gnu-as.exe'.

     To use GNU CC on VMS, you need the VMS driver programs `gcc.exe',
     `gcc.com', and `gcc.cld'.  They are distributed with the VMS
     binaries (`gcc-vms') rather than the GNU CC sources.  GAS is also
     included in `gcc-vms', as is Bison.

     Once you have successfully built GNU CC with VAX C, you should use
     the resulting compiler to rebuild itself.  Before doing this, be
     sure to restore the `CC', `CFLAGS', and `LIBS' definitions in
     `make-cccp.com' and `make-cc1.com'.  The second generation
     compiler will be able to take advantage of many optimizations that
     must be suppressed when building with other compilers.

   Under previous versions of GNU CC, the generated code would
occasionally give strange results when linked with the sharable
`VAXCRTL' library.  Now this should work.

   Even with this version, however, GNU CC itself should not be linked
with the sharable `VAXCRTL'.  The version of `qsort' in `VAXCRTL' has a
bug (known to be present in VMS versions V4.6 through V5.5) which
causes the compiler to fail.

   The executables are generated by `make-cc1.com' and `make-cccp.com'
use the object library version of `VAXCRTL' in order to make use of the
`qsort' routine in `gcclib.olb'.  If you wish to link the compiler
executables with the shareable image version of `VAXCRTL', you should
edit the file `tm.h' (created by `vmsconfig.com') to define the macro
`QSORT_WORKAROUND'.

   `QSORT_WORKAROUND' is always defined when GNU CC is compiled with
VAX C, to avoid a problem in case `gcclib.olb' is not yet available.




`collect2'
==========

   Many target systems do not have support in the assembler and linker
for "constructors"--initialization functions to be called before the
official "start" of `main'.  On such systems, GNU CC uses a utility
called `collect2' to arrange to call these functions at start time.

   The program `collect2' works by linking the program once and looking
through the linker output file for symbols with particular names
indicating they are constructor functions.  If it finds any, it creates
a new temporary `.c' file containing a table of them, compiles it, and
links the program a second time including that file.

   The actual calls to the constructors are carried out by a subroutine
called `__main', which is called (automatically) at the beginning of
the body of `main' (provided `main' was compiled with GNU CC).  Calling
`__main' is necessary, even when compiling C code, to allow linking C
and C++ object code together.  (If you use `-nostdlib', you get an
unresolved reference to `__main', since it's defined in the standard
GCC library.  Include `-lgcc' at the end of your compiler command line
to resolve this reference.)

   The program `collect2' is installed as `ld' in the directory where
the passes of the compiler are installed.  When `collect2' needs to
find the *real* `ld', it tries the following file names:

   * `real-ld' in the directories listed in the compiler's search
     directories.

   * `real-ld' in the directories listed in the environment variable
     `PATH'.

   * The file specified in the `REAL_LD_FILE_NAME' configuration macro,
     if specified.

   * `ld' in the compiler's search directories, except that `collect2'
     will not execute itself recursively.

   * `ld' in `PATH'.

   "The compiler's search directories" means all the directories where
`gcc' searches for passes of the compiler.  This includes directories
that you specify with `-B'.

   Cross-compilers search a little differently:

   * `real-ld' in the compiler's search directories.

   * `TARGET-real-ld' in `PATH'.

   * The file specified in the `REAL_LD_FILE_NAME' configuration macro,
     if specified.

   * `ld' in the compiler's search directories.

   * `TARGET-ld' in `PATH'.

   `collect2' explicitly avoids running `ld' using the file name under
which `collect2' itself was invoked.  In fact, it remembers up a list
of such names--in case one copy of `collect2' finds another copy (or
version) of `collect2' installed as `ld' in a second place in the
search path.

   `collect2' searches for the utilities `nm' and `strip' using the
same algorithm as above for `ld'.




Standard Header File Directories
================================

   `GCC_INCLUDE_DIR' means the same thing for native and cross.  It is
where GNU CC stores its private include files, and also where GNU CC
stores the fixed include files.  A cross compiled GNU CC runs
`fixincludes' on the header files in `$(tooldir)/include'.  (If the
cross compilation header files need to be fixed, they must be installed
before GNU CC is built.  If the cross compilation header files are
already suitable for ANSI C and GNU CC, nothing special need be done).

   `GPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR' means the same thing for native and cross.  It
is where `g++' looks first for header files.  `libg++' installs only
target independent header files in that directory.

   `LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR' is used only for a native compiler.  It is
normally `/usr/local/include'.  GNU CC searches this directory so that
users can install header files in `/usr/local/include'.

   `CROSS_INCLUDE_DIR' is used only for a cross compiler.  GNU CC
doesn't install anything there.

   `TOOL_INCLUDE_DIR' is used for both native and cross compilers.  It
is the place for other packages to install header files that GNU CC will
use.  For a cross-compiler, this is the equivalent of `/usr/include'.
When you build a cross-compiler, `fixincludes' processes any header
files in this directory.




Extensions to the C Language Family
***********************************

   GNU C provides several language features not found in ANSI standard
C.  (The `-pedantic' option directs GNU CC to print a warning message if
any of these features is used.)  To test for the availability of these
features in conditional compilation, check for a predefined macro
`__GNUC__', which is always defined under GNU CC.

   These extensions are available in C and Objective C.  Most of them
are also available in C++.  *Note Extensions to the C++ Language: C++
Extensions, for extensions that apply *only* to C++.


Statements and Declarations in Expressions
==========================================

   A compound statement enclosed in parentheses may appear as an
expression in GNU C.  This allows you to use loops, switches, and local
variables within an expression.

   Recall that a compound statement is a sequence of statements
surrounded by braces; in this construct, parentheses go around the
braces.  For example:

     ({ int y = foo (); int z;
        if (y > 0) z = y;
        else z = - y;
        z; })

is a valid (though slightly more complex than necessary) expression for
the absolute value of `foo ()'.

   The last thing in the compound statement should be an expression
followed by a semicolon; the value of this subexpression serves as the
value of the entire construct.  (If you use some other kind of statement
last within the braces, the construct has type `void', and thus
effectively no value.)

   This feature is especially useful in making macro definitions "safe"
(so that they evaluate each operand exactly once).  For example, the
"maximum" function is commonly defined as a macro in standard C as
follows:

     #define max(a,b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))

But this definition computes either A or B twice, with bad results if
the operand has side effects.  In GNU C, if you know the type of the
operands (here let's assume `int'), you can define the macro safely as
follows:

     #define maxint(a,b) \
       ({int _a = (a), _b = (b); _a > _b ? _a : _b; })

   Embedded statements are not allowed in constant expressions, such as
the value of an enumeration constant, the width of a bit field, or the
initial value of a static variable.

   If you don't know the type of the operand, you can still do this,
but you must use `typeof' (*note Typeof::.) or type naming (*note
Naming Types::.).




Locally Declared Labels
=======================

   Each statement expression is a scope in which "local labels" can be
declared.  A local label is simply an identifier; you can jump to it
with an ordinary `goto' statement, but only from within the statement
expression it belongs to.

   A local label declaration looks like this:

     __label__ LABEL;

or

     __label__ LABEL1, LABEL2, ...;

   Local label declarations must come at the beginning of the statement
expression, right after the `({', before any ordinary declarations.

   The label declaration defines the label *name*, but does not define
the label itself.  You must do this in the usual way, with `LABEL:',
within the statements of the statement expression.

   The local label feature is useful because statement expressions are
often used in macros.  If the macro contains nested loops, a `goto' can
be useful for breaking out of them.  However, an ordinary label whose
scope is the whole function cannot be used: if the macro can be
expanded several times in one function, the label will be multiply
defined in that function.  A local label avoids this problem.  For
example:

     #define SEARCH(array, target)                     \
     ({                                               \
       __label__ found;                                \
       typeof (target) _SEARCH_target = (target);      \
       typeof (*(array)) *_SEARCH_array = (array);     \
       int i, j;                                       \
       int value;                                      \
       for (i = 0; i < max; i++)                       \
         for (j = 0; j < max; j++)                     \
           if (_SEARCH_array[i][j] == _SEARCH_target)  \
             { value = i; goto found; }              \
       value = -1;                                     \
      found:                                           \
       value;                                          \
     })




Labels as Values
================

   You can get the address of a label defined in the current function
(or a containing function) with the unary operator `&&'.  The value has
type `void *'.  This value is a constant and can be used wherever a
constant of that type is valid.  For example:

     void *ptr;
     ...
     ptr = &&foo;

   To use these values, you need to be able to jump to one.  This is
done with the computed goto statement(1), `goto *EXP;'.  For example,

     goto *ptr;

Any expression of type `void *' is allowed.

   One way of using these constants is in initializing a static array
that will serve as a jump table:

     static void *array[] = { &&foo, &&bar, &&hack };

   Then you can select a label with indexing, like this:

     goto *array[i];

Note that this does not check whether the subscript is in bounds--array
indexing in C never does that.

   Such an array of label values serves a purpose much like that of the
`switch' statement.  The `switch' statement is cleaner, so use that
rather than an array unless the problem does not fit a `switch'
statement very well.

   Another use of label values is in an interpreter for threaded code.
The labels within the interpreter function can be stored in the
threaded code for super-fast dispatching.

   You can use this mechanism to jump to code in a different function.
If you do that, totally unpredictable things will happen.  The best way
to avoid this is to store the label address only in automatic variables
and never pass it as an argument.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1)  The analogous feature in Fortran is called an assigned goto,
but that name seems inappropriate in C, where one can do more than
simply store label addresses in label variables.




Nested Functions
================

   A "nested function" is a function defined inside another function.
(Nested functions are not supported for GNU C++.)  The nested function's
name is local to the block where it is defined.  For example, here we
define a nested function named `square', and call it twice:

     foo (double a, double b)
     {
       double square (double z) { return z * z; }

       return square (a) + square (b);
     }

   The nested function can access all the variables of the containing
function that are visible at the point of its definition.  This is
called "lexical scoping".  For example, here we show a nested function
which uses an inherited variable named `offset':

     bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
     {
       int access (int *array, int index)
         { return array[index + offset]; }
       int i;
       ...
       for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
         ... access (array, i) ...
     }

   Nested function definitions are permitted within functions in the
places where variable definitions are allowed; that is, in any block,
before the first statement in the block.

   It is possible to call the nested function from outside the scope of
its name by storing its address or passing the address to another
function:

     hack (int *array, int size)
     {
       void store (int index, int value)
         { array[index] = value; }

       intermediate (store, size);
     }

   Here, the function `intermediate' receives the address of `store' as
an argument.  If `intermediate' calls `store', the arguments given to
`store' are used to store into `array'.  But this technique works only
so long as the containing function (`hack', in this example) does not
exit.

   If you try to call the nested function through its address after the
containing function has exited, all hell will break loose.  If you try
to call it after a containing scope level has exited, and if it refers
to some of the variables that are no longer in scope, you may be lucky,
but it's not wise to take the risk.  If, however, the nested function
does not refer to anything that has gone out of scope, you should be
safe.

   GNU CC implements taking the address of a nested function using a
technique called "trampolines".  A paper describing them is available
from `maya.idiap.ch' in directory `pub/tmb', file `usenix88-lexic.ps.Z'.

   A nested function can jump to a label inherited from a containing
function, provided the label was explicitly declared in the containing
function (*note Local Labels::.).  Such a jump returns instantly to the
containing function, exiting the nested function which did the `goto'
and any intermediate functions as well.  Here is an example:

     bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
     {
       __label__ failure;
       int access (int *array, int index)
         {
           if (index > size)
             goto failure;
           return array[index + offset];
         }
       int i;
       ...
       for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
         ... access (array, i) ...
       ...
       return 0;

      /* Control comes here from `access'
         if it detects an error.  */
      failure:
       return -1;
     }

   A nested function always has internal linkage.  Declaring one with
`extern' is erroneous.  If you need to declare the nested function
before its definition, use `auto' (which is otherwise meaningless for
function declarations).

     bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
     {
       __label__ failure;
       auto int access (int *, int);
       ...
       int access (int *array, int index)
         {
           if (index > size)
             goto failure;
           return array[index + offset];
         }
       ...
     }




Constructing Function Calls
===========================

   Using the built-in functions described below, you can record the
arguments a function received, and call another function with the same
arguments, without knowing the number or types of the arguments.

   You can also record the return value of that function call, and
later return that value, without knowing what data type the function
tried to return (as long as your caller expects that data type).

`__builtin_apply_args ()'
     This built-in function returns a pointer of type `void *' to data
     describing how to perform a call with the same arguments as were
     passed to the current function.

     The function saves the arg pointer register, structure value
     address, and all registers that might be used to pass arguments to
     a function into a block of memory allocated on the stack.  Then it
     returns the address of that block.

`__builtin_apply (FUNCTION, ARGUMENTS, SIZE)'
     This built-in function invokes FUNCTION (type `void (*)()') with a
     copy of the parameters described by ARGUMENTS (type `void *') and
     SIZE (type `int').

     The value of ARGUMENTS should be the value returned by
     `__builtin_apply_args'.  The argument SIZE specifies the size of
     the stack argument data, in bytes.

     This function returns a pointer of type `void *' to data describing
     how to return whatever value was returned by FUNCTION.  The data
     is saved in a block of memory allocated on the stack.

     It is not always simple to compute the proper value for SIZE.  The
     value is used by `__builtin_apply' to compute the amount of data
     that should be pushed on the stack and copied from the incoming
     argument area.

`__builtin_return (RESULT)'
     This built-in function returns the value described by RESULT from
     the containing function.  You should specify, for RESULT, a value
     returned by `__builtin_apply'.




Naming an Expression's Type
===========================

   You can give a name to the type of an expression using a `typedef'
declaration with an initializer.  Here is how to define NAME as a type
name for the type of EXP:

     typedef NAME = EXP;

   This is useful in conjunction with the statements-within-expressions
feature.  Here is how the two together can be used to define a safe
"maximum" macro that operates on any arithmetic type:

     #define max(a,b) \
       ({typedef _ta = (a), _tb = (b);  \
         _ta _a = (a); _tb _b = (b);     \
         _a > _b ? _a : _b; })

   The reason for using names that start with underscores for the local
variables is to avoid conflicts with variable names that occur within
the expressions that are substituted for `a' and `b'.  Eventually we
hope to design a new form of declaration syntax that allows you to
declare variables whose scopes start only after their initializers;
this will be a more reliable way to prevent such conflicts.




Referring to a Type with `typeof'
=================================

   Another way to refer to the type of an expression is with `typeof'.
The syntax of using of this keyword looks like `sizeof', but the
construct acts semantically like a type name defined with `typedef'.

   There are two ways of writing the argument to `typeof': with an
expression or with a type.  Here is an example with an expression:

     typeof (x[0](1))

This assumes that `x' is an array of functions; the type described is
that of the values of the functions.

   Here is an example with a typename as the argument:

     typeof (int *)

Here the type described is that of pointers to `int'.

   If you are writing a header file that must work when included in
ANSI C programs, write `__typeof__' instead of `typeof'.  *Note
Alternate Keywords::.

   A `typeof'-construct can be used anywhere a typedef name could be
used.  For example, you can use it in a declaration, in a cast, or
inside of `sizeof' or `typeof'.

   * This declares `y' with the type of what `x' points to.

          typeof (*x) y;

   * This declares `y' as an array of such values.

          typeof (*x) y[4];

   * This declares `y' as an array of pointers to characters:

          typeof (typeof (char *)[4]) y;

     It is equivalent to the following traditional C declaration:

          char *y[4];

     To see the meaning of the declaration using `typeof', and why it
     might be a useful way to write, let's rewrite it with these macros:

          #define pointer(T)  typeof(T *)
          #define array(T, N) typeof(T [N])

     Now the declaration can be rewritten this way:

          array (pointer (char), 4) y;

     Thus, `array (pointer (char), 4)' is the type of arrays of 4
     pointers to `char'.




Generalized Lvalues
===================

   Compound expressions, conditional expressions and casts are allowed
as lvalues provided their operands are lvalues.  This means that you
can take their addresses or store values into them.

   Standard C++ allows compound expressions and conditional expressions
as lvalues, and permits casts to reference type, so use of this
extension is deprecated for C++ code.

   For example, a compound expression can be assigned, provided the last
expression in the sequence is an lvalue.  These two expressions are
equivalent:

     (a, b) += 5
     a, (b += 5)

   Similarly, the address of the compound expression can be taken.
These two expressions are equivalent:

     &(a, b)
     a, &b

   A conditional expression is a valid lvalue if its type is not void
and the true and false branches are both valid lvalues.  For example,
these two expressions are equivalent:

     (a ? b : c) = 5
     (a ? b = 5 : (c = 5))

   A cast is a valid lvalue if its operand is an lvalue.  A simple
assignment whose left-hand side is a cast works by converting the
right-hand side first to the specified type, then to the type of the
inner left-hand side expression.  After this is stored, the value is
converted back to the specified type to become the value of the
assignment.  Thus, if `a' has type `char *', the following two
expressions are equivalent:

     (int)a = 5
     (int)(a = (char *)(int)5)

   An assignment-with-arithmetic operation such as `+=' applied to a
cast performs the arithmetic using the type resulting from the cast,
and then continues as in the previous case.  Therefore, these two
expressions are equivalent:

     (int)a += 5
     (int)(a = (char *)(int) ((int)a + 5))

   You cannot take the address of an lvalue cast, because the use of its
address would not work out coherently.  Suppose that `&(int)f' were
permitted, where `f' has type `float'.  Then the following statement
would try to store an integer bit-pattern where a floating point number
belongs:

     *&(int)f = 1;

   This is quite different from what `(int)f = 1' would do--that would
convert 1 to floating point and store it.  Rather than cause this
inconsistency, we think it is better to prohibit use of `&' on a cast.

   If you really do want an `int *' pointer with the address of `f',
you can simply write `(int *)&f'.




Conditionals with Omitted Operands
==================================

   The middle operand in a conditional expression may be omitted.  Then
if the first operand is nonzero, its value is the value of the
conditional expression.

   Therefore, the expression

     x ? : y

has the value of `x' if that is nonzero; otherwise, the value of `y'.

   This example is perfectly equivalent to

     x ? x : y

In this simple case, the ability to omit the middle operand is not
especially useful.  When it becomes useful is when the first operand
does, or may (if it is a macro argument), contain a side effect.  Then
repeating the operand in the middle would perform the side effect
twice.  Omitting the middle operand uses the value already computed
without the undesirable effects of recomputing it.




Double-Word Integers
====================

   GNU C supports data types for integers that are twice as long as
`long int'.  Simply write `long long int' for a signed integer, or
`unsigned long long int' for an unsigned integer.  To make an integer
constant of type `long long int', add the suffix `LL' to the integer.
To make an integer constant of type `unsigned long long int', add the
suffix `ULL' to the integer.

   You can use these types in arithmetic like any other integer types.
Addition, subtraction, and bitwise boolean operations on these types
are open-coded on all types of machines.  Multiplication is open-coded
if the machine supports fullword-to-doubleword a widening multiply
instruction.  Division and shifts are open-coded only on machines that
provide special support.  The operations that are not open-coded use
special library routines that come with GNU CC.

   There may be pitfalls when you use `long long' types for function
arguments, unless you declare function prototypes.  If a function
expects type `int' for its argument, and you pass a value of type `long
long int', confusion will result because the caller and the subroutine
will disagree about the number of bytes for the argument.  Likewise, if
the function expects `long long int' and you pass `int'.  The best way
to avoid such problems is to use prototypes.




Complex Numbers
===============

   GNU C supports complex data types.  You can declare both complex
integer types and complex floating types, using the keyword
`__complex__'.

   For example, `__complex__ double x;' declares `x' as a variable
whose real part and imaginary part are both of type `double'.
`__complex__ short int y;' declares `y' to have real and imaginary
parts of type `short int'; this is not likely to be useful, but it
shows that the set of complex types is complete.

   To write a constant with a complex data type, use the suffix `i' or
`j' (either one; they are equivalent).  For example, `2.5fi' has type
`__complex__ float' and `3i' has type `__complex__ int'.  Such a
constant always has a pure imaginary value, but you can form any
complex value you like by adding one to a real constant.

   To extract the real part of a complex-valued expression EXP, write
`__real__ EXP'.  Likewise, use `__imag__' to extract the imaginary part.

   The operator `~' performs complex conjugation when used on a value
with a complex type.

   GNU CC can allocate complex automatic variables in a noncontiguous
fashion; it's even possible for the real part to be in a register while
the imaginary part is on the stack (or vice-versa).  None of the
supported debugging info formats has a way to represent noncontiguous
allocation like this, so GNU CC describes a noncontiguous complex
variable as if it were two separate variables of noncomplex type.  If
the variable's actual name is `foo', the two fictitious variables are
named `foo$real' and `foo$imag'.  You can examine and set these two
fictitious variables with your debugger.

   A future version of GDB will know how to recognize such pairs and
treat them as a single variable with a complex type.




Arrays of Length Zero
=====================

   Zero-length arrays are allowed in GNU C.  They are very useful as
the last element of a structure which is really a header for a
variable-length object:

     struct line {
       int length;
       char contents[0];
     };

     {
       struct line *thisline = (struct line *)
         malloc (sizeof (struct line) + this_length);
       thisline->length = this_length;
     }

   In standard C, you would have to give `contents' a length of 1, which
means either you waste space or complicate the argument to `malloc'.




Arrays of Variable Length
=========================

   Variable-length automatic arrays are allowed in GNU C.  These arrays
are declared like any other automatic arrays, but with a length that is
not a constant expression.  The storage is allocated at the point of
declaration and deallocated when the brace-level is exited.  For
example:

     FILE *
     concat_fopen (char *s1, char *s2, char *mode)
     {
       char str[strlen (s1) + strlen (s2) + 1];
       strcpy (str, s1);
       strcat (str, s2);
       return fopen (str, mode);
     }

   Jumping or breaking out of the scope of the array name deallocates
the storage.  Jumping into the scope is not allowed; you get an error
message for it.

   You can use the function `alloca' to get an effect much like
variable-length arrays.  The function `alloca' is available in many
other C implementations (but not in all).  On the other hand,
variable-length arrays are more elegant.

   There are other differences between these two methods.  Space
allocated with `alloca' exists until the containing *function* returns.
The space for a variable-length array is deallocated as soon as the
array name's scope ends.  (If you use both variable-length arrays and
`alloca' in the same function, deallocation of a variable-length array
will also deallocate anything more recently allocated with `alloca'.)

   You can also use variable-length arrays as arguments to functions:

     struct entry
     tester (int len, char data[len][len])
     {
       ...
     }

   The length of an array is computed once when the storage is allocated
and is remembered for the scope of the array in case you access it with
`sizeof'.

   If you want to pass the array first and the length afterward, you can
use a forward declaration in the parameter list--another GNU extension.

     struct entry
     tester (int len; char data[len][len], int len)
     {
       ...
     }

   The `int len' before the semicolon is a "parameter forward
declaration", and it serves the purpose of making the name `len' known
when the declaration of `data' is parsed.

   You can write any number of such parameter forward declarations in
the parameter list.  They can be separated by commas or semicolons, but
the last one must end with a semicolon, which is followed by the "real"
parameter declarations.  Each forward declaration must match a "real"
declaration in parameter name and data type.




Macros with Variable Numbers of Arguments
=========================================

   In GNU C, a macro can accept a variable number of arguments, much as
a function can.  The syntax for defining the macro looks much like that
used for a function.  Here is an example:

     #define eprintf(format, args...)  \
      fprintf (stderr, format , ## args)

   Here `args' is a "rest argument": it takes in zero or more
arguments, as many as the call contains.  All of them plus the commas
between them form the value of `args', which is substituted into the
macro body where `args' is used.  Thus, we have this expansion:

     eprintf ("%s:%d: ", input_file_name, line_number)
     ==>
     fprintf (stderr, "%s:%d: " , input_file_name, line_number)

Note that the comma after the string constant comes from the definition
of `eprintf', whereas the last comma comes from the value of `args'.

   The reason for using `##' is to handle the case when `args' matches
no arguments at all.  In this case, `args' has an empty value.  In this
case, the second comma in the definition becomes an embarrassment: if
it got through to the expansion of the macro, we would get something
like this:

     fprintf (stderr, "success!\n" , )

which is invalid C syntax.  `##' gets rid of the comma, so we get the
following instead:

     fprintf (stderr, "success!\n")

   This is a special feature of the GNU C preprocessor: `##' before a
rest argument that is empty discards the preceding sequence of
non-whitespace characters from the macro definition.  (If another macro
argument precedes, none of it is discarded.)

   It might be better to discard the last preprocessor token instead of
the last preceding sequence of non-whitespace characters; in fact, we
may someday change this feature to do so.  We advise you to write the
macro definition so that the preceding sequence of non-whitespace
characters is just a single token, so that the meaning will not change
if we change the definition of this feature.




Non-Lvalue Arrays May Have Subscripts
=====================================

   Subscripting is allowed on arrays that are not lvalues, even though
the unary `&' operator is not.  For example, this is valid in GNU C
though not valid in other C dialects:

     struct foo {int a[4];};

     struct foo f();

     bar (int index)
     {
       return f().a[index];
     }




Arithmetic on `void'- and Function-Pointers
===========================================

   In GNU C, addition and subtraction operations are supported on
pointers to `void' and on pointers to functions.  This is done by
treating the size of a `void' or of a function as 1.

   A consequence of this is that `sizeof' is also allowed on `void' and
on function types, and returns 1.

   The option `-Wpointer-arith' requests a warning if these extensions
are used.




Non-Constant Initializers
=========================

   As in standard C++, the elements of an aggregate initializer for an
automatic variable are not required to be constant expressions in GNU C.
Here is an example of an initializer with run-time varying elements:

     foo (float f, float g)
     {
       float beat_freqs[2] = { f-g, f+g };
       ...
     }




Constructor Expressions
=======================

   GNU C supports constructor expressions.  A constructor looks like a
cast containing an initializer.  Its value is an object of the type
specified in the cast, containing the elements specified in the
initializer.

   Usually, the specified type is a structure.  Assume that `struct
foo' and `structure' are declared as shown:

     struct foo {int a; char b[2];} structure;

Here is an example of constructing a `struct foo' with a constructor:

     structure = ((struct foo) {x + y, 'a', 0});

This is equivalent to writing the following:

     {
       struct foo temp = {x + y, 'a', 0};
       structure = temp;
     }

   You can also construct an array.  If all the elements of the
constructor are (made up of) simple constant expressions, suitable for
use in initializers, then the constructor is an lvalue and can be
coerced to a pointer to its first element, as shown here:

     char **foo = (char *[]) { "x", "y", "z" };

   Array constructors whose elements are not simple constants are not
very useful, because the constructor is not an lvalue.  There are only
two valid ways to use it: to subscript it, or initialize an array
variable with it.  The former is probably slower than a `switch'
statement, while the latter does the same thing an ordinary C
initializer would do.  Here is an example of subscripting an array
constructor:

     output = ((int[]) { 2, x, 28 }) [input];

   Constructor expressions for scalar types and union types are is also
allowed, but then the constructor expression is equivalent to a cast.




Labeled Elements in Initializers
================================

   Standard C requires the elements of an initializer to appear in a
fixed order, the same as the order of the elements in the array or
structure being initialized.

   In GNU C you can give the elements in any order, specifying the array
indices or structure field names they apply to.  This extension is not
implemented in GNU C++.

   To specify an array index, write `[INDEX]' or `[INDEX] =' before the
element value.  For example,

     int a[6] = { [4] 29, [2] = 15 };

is equivalent to

     int a[6] = { 0, 0, 15, 0, 29, 0 };

The index values must be constant expressions, even if the array being
initialized is automatic.

   To initialize a range of elements to the same value, write `[FIRST
... LAST] = VALUE'.  For example,

     int widths[] = { [0 ... 9] = 1, [10 ... 99] = 2, [100] = 3 };

Note that the length of the array is the highest value specified plus
one.

   In a structure initializer, specify the name of a field to initialize
with `FIELDNAME:' before the element value.  For example, given the
following structure,

     struct point { int x, y; };

the following initialization

     struct point p = { y: yvalue, x: xvalue };

is equivalent to

     struct point p = { xvalue, yvalue };

   Another syntax which has the same meaning is `.FIELDNAME ='., as
shown here:

     struct point p = { .y = yvalue, .x = xvalue };

   You can also use an element label (with either the colon syntax or
the period-equal syntax) when initializing a union, to specify which
element of the union should be used.  For example,

     union foo { int i; double d; };

     union foo f = { d: 4 };

will convert 4 to a `double' to store it in the union using the second
element.  By contrast, casting 4 to type `union foo' would store it
into the union as the integer `i', since it is an integer.  (*Note Cast
to Union::.)

   You can combine this technique of naming elements with ordinary C
initialization of successive elements.  Each initializer element that
does not have a label applies to the next consecutive element of the
array or structure.  For example,

     int a[6] = { [1] = v1, v2, [4] = v4 };

is equivalent to

     int a[6] = { 0, v1, v2, 0, v4, 0 };

   Labeling the elements of an array initializer is especially useful
when the indices are characters or belong to an `enum' type.  For
example:

     int whitespace[256]
       = { [' '] = 1, ['\t'] = 1, ['\h'] = 1,
           ['\f'] = 1, ['\n'] = 1, ['\r'] = 1 };

Case Ranges
===========

   You can specify a range of consecutive values in a single `case'
label, like this:

     case LOW ... HIGH:

This has the same effect as the proper number of individual `case'
labels, one for each integer value from LOW to HIGH, inclusive.

   This feature is especially useful for ranges of ASCII character
codes:

     case 'A' ... 'Z':

   *Be careful:* Write spaces around the `...', for otherwise it may be
parsed wrong when you use it with integer values.  For example, write
this:

     case 1 ... 5:

rather than this:

     case 1...5:




Cast to a Union Type
====================

   A cast to union type is similar to other casts, except that the type
specified is a union type.  You can specify the type either with `union
TAG' or with a typedef name.  A cast to union is actually a constructor
though, not a cast, and hence does not yield an lvalue like normal
casts.  (*Note Constructors::.)

   The types that may be cast to the union type are those of the members
of the union.  Thus, given the following union and variables:

     union foo { int i; double d; };
     int x;
     double y;

both `x' and `y' can be cast to type `union' foo.

   Using the cast as the right-hand side of an assignment to a variable
of union type is equivalent to storing in a member of the union:

     union foo u;
     ...
     u = (union foo) x  ==  u.i = x
     u = (union foo) y  ==  u.d = y

   You can also use the union cast as a function argument:

     void hack (union foo);
     ...
     hack ((union foo) x);




Declaring Attributes of Functions
=================================

   In GNU C, you declare certain things about functions called in your
program which help the compiler optimize function calls and check your
code more carefully.

   The keyword `__attribute__' allows you to specify special attributes
when making a declaration.  This keyword is followed by an attribute
specification inside double parentheses.  Four attributes, `noreturn',
`const', `format', and `section' are currently defined for functions.
Other attributes, including `section' are supported for variables
declarations (*note Variable Attributes::.).

   You may also specify attributes with `__' preceeding and following
each keyword.  This allows you to use them in header files without
being concerned about a possible macro of the same name.  For example,
you may use `__noreturn__' instead of `noreturn'.

`noreturn'
     A few standard library functions, such as `abort' and `exit',
     cannot return.  GNU CC knows this automatically.  Some programs
     define their own functions that never return.  You can declare them
     `noreturn' to tell the compiler this fact.  For example,

          void fatal () __attribute__ ((noreturn));

          void
          fatal (...)
          {
            ... /* Print error message. */ ...
            exit (1);
          }

     The `noreturn' keyword tells the compiler to assume that `fatal'
     cannot return.  It can then optimize without regard to what would
     happen if `fatal' ever did return.  This makes slightly better
     code.  More importantly, it helps avoid spurious warnings of
     uninitialized variables.

     Do not assume that registers saved by the calling function are
     restored before calling the `noreturn' function.

     It does not make sense for a `noreturn' function to have a return
     type other than `void'.

     The attribute `noreturn' is not implemented in GNU C versions
     earlier than 2.5.  An alternative way to declare that a function
     does not return, which works in the current version and in some
     older versions, is as follows:

          typedef void voidfn ();

          volatile voidfn fatal;

`const'
     Many functions do not examine any values except their arguments,
     and have no effects except the return value.  Such a function can
     be subject to common subexpression elimination and loop
     optimization just as an arithmetic operator would be.  These
     functions should be declared with the attribute `const'.  For
     example,

          int square (int) __attribute__ ((const));

     says that the hypothetical function `square' is safe to call fewer
     times than the program says.

     The attribute `const' is not implemented in GNU C versions earlier
     than 2.5.  An alternative way to declare that a function has no
     side effects, which works in the current version and in some older
     versions, is as follows:

          typedef int intfn ();

          extern const intfn square;

     This approach does not work in GNU C++ from 2.6.0 on, since the
     language specifies that the `const' must be attached to the return
     value.

     Note that a function that has pointer arguments and examines the
     data pointed to must *not* be declared `const'.  Likewise, a
     function that calls a non-`const' function usually must not be
     `const'.  It does not make sense for a `const' function to return
     `void'.

`format (ARCHETYPE, STRING-INDEX, FIRST-TO-CHECK)'
     The `format' attribute specifies that a function takes `printf' or
     `scanf' style arguments which should be type-checked against a
     format string.  For example, the declaration:

          extern int
          my_printf (void *my_object, const char *my_format, ...)
                __attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 3)));

     causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to `my_printf'
     for consistency with the `printf' style format string argument
     `my_format'.

     The parameter ARCHETYPE determines how the format string is
     interpreted, and should be either `printf' or `scanf'.  The
     parameter STRING-INDEX specifies which argument is the format
     string argument (starting from 1), while FIRST-TO-CHECK is the
     number of the first argument to check against the format string.
     For functions where the arguments are not available to be checked
     (such as `vprintf'), specify the third parameter as zero.  In this
     case the compiler only checks the format string for consistency.

     In the example above, the format string (`my_format') is the second
     argument of the function `my_print', and the arguments to check
     start with the third argument, so the correct parameters for the
     format attribute are 2 and 3.

     The `format' attribute allows you to identify your own functions
     which take format strings as arguments, so that GNU CC can check
     the calls to these functions for errors.  The compiler always
     checks formats for the ANSI library functions `printf', `fprintf',
     `sprintf', `scanf', `fscanf', `sscanf', `vprintf', `vfprintf' and
     `vsprintf' whenever such warnings are requested (using
     `-Wformat'), so there is no need to modify the header file
     `stdio.h'.

`section ("section-name")'
     Normally, the compiler places the code it generates in the `text'
     section.  Sometimes, however, you need additional sections, or you
     need certain particular functions to appear in special sections.
     The `section' attribute specifies that a function lives in a
     particular section.  For example, the declaration:

          extern void foobar (void) __attribute__ ((section (".init")));

     puts the function `foobar' in the `.init' section.

     Some file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the
     `section' attribute is not available on all platforms.  If you
     need to map the entire contents of a module to a particular
     section, consider using the facilities of the linker instead.

   You can specify multiple attributes in a declaration by separating
them by commas within the double parentheses or by immediately
following an attribute declaration with another attribute declaration.

   Some people object to the `__attribute__' feature, suggesting that
ANSI C's `#pragma' should be used instead.  There are two reasons for
not doing this.

  1. It is impossible to generate `#pragma' commands from a macro.

  2. There is no telling what the same `#pragma' might mean in another
     compiler.

   These two reasons apply to almost any application that might be
proposed for `#pragma'.  It is basically a mistake to use `#pragma' for
*anything*.




Prototypes and Old-Style Function Definitions
=============================================

   GNU C extends ANSI C to allow a function prototype to override a
later old-style non-prototype definition.  Consider the following
example:

     /* Use prototypes unless the compiler is old-fashioned.  */
     #if __STDC__
     #define P(x) x
     #else
     #define P(x) ()
     #endif

     /* Prototype function declaration.  */
     int isroot P((uid_t));

     /* Old-style function definition.  */
     int
     isroot (x)   /* ??? lossage here ??? */
          uid_t x;
     {
       return x == 0;
     }

   Suppose the type `uid_t' happens to be `short'.  ANSI C does not
allow this example, because subword arguments in old-style
non-prototype definitions are promoted.  Therefore in this example the
function definition's argument is really an `int', which does not match
the prototype argument type of `short'.

   This restriction of ANSI C makes it hard to write code that is
portable to traditional C compilers, because the programmer does not
know whether the `uid_t' type is `short', `int', or `long'.  Therefore,
in cases like these GNU C allows a prototype to override a later
old-style definition.  More precisely, in GNU C, a function prototype
argument type overrides the argument type specified by a later
old-style definition if the former type is the same as the latter type
before promotion.  Thus in GNU C the above example is equivalent to the
following:

     int isroot (uid_t);

     int
     isroot (uid_t x)
     {
       return x == 0;
     }

   GNU C++ does not support old-style function definitions, so this
extension is irrelevant.




Dollar Signs in Identifier Names
================================

   In GNU C, you may use dollar signs in identifier names.  This is
because many traditional C implementations allow such identifiers.

   On some machines, dollar signs are allowed in identifiers if you
specify `-traditional'.  On a few systems they are allowed by default,
even if you do not use `-traditional'.  But they are never allowed if
you specify `-ansi'.

   There are certain ANSI C programs (obscure, to be sure) that would
compile incorrectly if dollar signs were permitted in identifiers.  For
example:

     #define foo(a) #a
     #define lose(b) foo (b)
     #define test$
     lose (test)




The Character ESC in Constants
==============================

   You can use the sequence `\e' in a string or character constant to
stand for the ASCII character ESC.




Inquiring on Alignment of Types or Variables
============================================

   The keyword `__alignof__' allows you to inquire about how an object
is aligned, or the minimum alignment usually required by a type.  Its
syntax is just like `sizeof'.

   For example, if the target machine requires a `double' value to be
aligned on an 8-byte boundary, then `__alignof__ (double)' is 8.  This
is true on many RISC machines.  On more traditional machine designs,
`__alignof__ (double)' is 4 or even 2.

   Some machines never actually require alignment; they allow reference
to any data type even at an odd addresses.  For these machines,
`__alignof__' reports the *recommended* alignment of a type.

   When the operand of `__alignof__' is an lvalue rather than a type,
the value is the largest alignment that the lvalue is known to have.
It may have this alignment as a result of its data type, or because it
is part of a structure and inherits alignment from that structure.  For
example, after this declaration:

     struct foo { int x; char y; } foo1;

the value of `__alignof__ (foo1.y)' is probably 2 or 4, the same as
`__alignof__ (int)', even though the data type of `foo1.y' does not
itself demand any alignment.

   A related feature which lets you specify the alignment of an object
is `__attribute__ ((aligned (ALIGNMENT)))'; see the following section.




Specifying Attributes of Variables
==================================

   The keyword `__attribute__' allows you to specify special attributes
of variables or structure fields.  This keyword is followed by an
attribute specification inside double parentheses.  Four attributes are
currently defined for variables: `aligned', `mode', `packed', and
`section'.  Other attributes are defined for functions, and thus not
documented here; see *Note Function Attributes::.

   You may also specify attributes with `__' preceeding and following
each keyword.  This allows you to use them in header files without
being concerned about a possible macro of the same name.  For example,
you may use `__aligned__' instead of `aligned'.

`aligned (ALIGNMENT)'
     This attribute specifies a minimum alignment for the variable or
     structure field, measured in bytes.  For example, the declaration:

          int x __attribute__ ((aligned (16))) = 0;

     causes the compiler to allocate the global variable `x' on a
     16-byte boundary.  On a 68040, this could be used in conjunction
     with an `asm' expression to access the `move16' instruction which
     requires 16-byte aligned operands.

     You can also specify the alignment of structure fields.  For
     example, to create a double-word aligned `int' pair, you could
     write:

          struct foo { int x[2] __attribute__ ((aligned (8))); };

     This is an alternative to creating a union with a `double' member
     that forces the union to be double-word aligned.

     It is not possible to specify the alignment of functions; the
     alignment of functions is determined by the machine's requirements
     and cannot be changed.  You cannot specify alignment for a typedef
     name because such a name is just an alias, not a distinct type.

     The `aligned' attribute can only increase the alignment; but you
     can decrease it by specifying `packed' as well.  See below.

     The linker of your operating system imposes a maximum alignment.
     If the linker aligns each object file on a four byte boundary,
     then it is beyond the compiler's power to cause anything to be
     aligned to a larger boundary than that.  For example, if  the
     linker happens to put this object file at address 136 (eight more
     than a multiple of 64), then the compiler cannot guarantee an
     alignment of more than 8 just by aligning variables in the object
     file.

`mode (MODE)'
     This attribute specifies the data type for the
     declaration--whichever type corresponds to the mode MODE.  This in
     effect lets you request an integer or floating point type
     according to its width.

`packed'
     The `packed' attribute specifies that a variable or structure field
     should have the smallest possible alignment--one byte for a
     variable, and one bit for a field, unless you specify a larger
     value with the `aligned' attribute.

     Here is a structure in which the field `x' is packed, so that it
     immediately follows `a':

          struct foo
          {
            char a;
            int x[2] __attribute__ ((packed));
          };

`section ("section-name")'
     Normally, the compiler places the objects it generates in sections
     like `data' and `bss'.  Sometimes, however, you need additional
     sections, or you need certain particular variables to appear in
     special sections, for example to map to special hardware.  The
     `section' attribute specifies that a variable (or function) lives
     in a particular section.  For example, this small program uses
     several specific section names:

          struct duart a __attribute__ ((section ("DUART_A"))) = { 0 };
          struct duart b __attribute__ ((section ("DUART_B"))) = { 0 };
          char stack[10000] __attribute__ ((section ("STACK"))) = { 0 };
          int init_data_copy __attribute__ ((section ("INITDATACOPY")))
= 0;

          main()
          {
            /* Initialize stack pointer */
            init_sp (stack + sizeof (stack));

            /* Initialize initialized data */
            memcpy (&init_data_copy, &data, &edata - &data);

            /* Turn on the serial ports */
            init_duart (&a);
            init_duart (&b);
          }

     Use the `section' attribute with an *initialized* definition of a
     *global* variable, as shown in the example.  GNU CC issues a
     warning and otherwise ignores the `section' attribute in
     uninitialized variable declarations.

     You may only use the `section' attribute with a fully initialized
     global definition because of the way linkers work.  The linker
     requires each object be defined once, with the exception that
     uninitialized variables tentatively go in the `common' (or `bss')
     section and can be multiply "defined".

     Some file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the
     `section' attribute is not available on all platforms.  If you
     need to map the entire contents of a module to a particular
     section, consider using the facilities of the linker instead.

`transparent_union'
     This attribute, attached to a function argument variable which is a
     union, means to pass the argument in the same way that the first
     union alternative would be passed.  You can also use this
     attribute on a `typedef' for a union data type; then it applies to
     all function arguments with that type.

   To specify multiple attributes, separate them by commas within the
double parentheses: for example, `__attribute__ ((aligned (16),
packed))'.




An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro
========================================

   By declaring a function `inline', you can direct GNU CC to integrate
that function's code into the code for its callers.  This makes
execution faster by eliminating the function-call overhead; in
addition, if any of the actual argument values are constant, their known
values may permit simplifications at compile time so that not all of the
inline function's code needs to be included.  The effect on code size is
less predictable; object code may be larger or smaller with function
inlining, depending on the particular case.  Inlining of functions is an
optimization and it really "works" only in optimizing compilation.  If
you don't use `-O', no function is really inline.

   To declare a function inline, use the `inline' keyword in its
declaration, like this:

     inline int
     inc (int *a)
     {
       (*a)++;
     }

   (If you are writing a header file to be included in ANSI C programs,
write `__inline__' instead of `inline'.  *Note Alternate Keywords::.)

   You can also make all "simple enough" functions inline with the
option `-finline-functions'.  Note that certain usages in a function
definition can make it unsuitable for inline substitution.

   Note that in C and Objective C, unlike C++, the `inline' keyword
does not affect the linkage of the function.

   GNU CC automatically inlines member functions defined within the
class body of C++ programs even if they are not explicitly declared
`inline'.  (You can override this with `-fno-default-inline'; *note
Options Controlling C++ Dialect: C++ Dialect Options..)

   When a function is both inline and `static', if all calls to the
function are integrated into the caller, and the function's address is
never used, then the function's own assembler code is never referenced.
In this case, GNU CC does not actually output assembler code for the
function, unless you specify the option `-fkeep-inline-functions'.
Some calls cannot be integrated for various reasons (in particular,
calls that precede the function's definition cannot be integrated, and
neither can recursive calls within the definition).  If there is a
nonintegrated call, then the function is compiled to assembler code as
usual.  The function must also be compiled as usual if the program
refers to its address, because that can't be inlined.

   When an inline function is not `static', then the compiler must
assume that there may be calls from other source files; since a global
symbol can be defined only once in any program, the function must not
be defined in the other source files, so the calls therein cannot be
integrated.  Therefore, a non-`static' inline function is always
compiled on its own in the usual fashion.

   If you specify both `inline' and `extern' in the function
definition, then the definition is used only for inlining.  In no case
is the function compiled on its own, not even if you refer to its
address explicitly.  Such an address becomes an external reference, as
if you had only declared the function, and had not defined it.

   This combination of `inline' and `extern' has almost the effect of a
macro.  The way to use it is to put a function definition in a header
file with these keywords, and put another copy of the definition
(lacking `inline' and `extern') in a library file.  The definition in
the header file will cause most calls to the function to be inlined.
If any uses of the function remain, they will refer to the single copy
in the library.

   GNU C does not inline any functions when not optimizing.  It is not
clear whether it is better to inline or not, in this case, but we found
that a correct implementation when not optimizing was difficult.  So we
did the easy thing, and turned it off.




Assembler Instructions with C Expression Operands
=================================================

   In an assembler instruction using `asm', you can now specify the
operands of the instruction using C expressions.  This means no more
guessing which registers or memory locations will contain the data you
want to use.

   You must specify an assembler instruction template much like what
appears in a machine description, plus an operand constraint string for
each operand.

   For example, here is how to use the 68881's `fsinx' instruction:

     asm ("fsinx %1,%0" : "=f" (result) : "f" (angle));

Here `angle' is the C expression for the input operand while `result'
is that of the output operand.  Each has `"f"' as its operand
constraint, saying that a floating point register is required.  The `='
in `=f' indicates that the operand is an output; all output operands'
constraints must use `='.  The constraints use the same language used
in the machine description (*note Constraints::.).

   Each operand is described by an operand-constraint string followed
by the C expression in parentheses.  A colon separates the assembler
template from the first output operand, and another separates the last
output operand from the first input, if any.  Commas separate output
operands and separate inputs.  The total number of operands is limited
to ten or to the maximum number of operands in any instruction pattern
in the machine description, whichever is greater.

   If there are no output operands, and there are input operands, then
there must be two consecutive colons surrounding the place where the
output operands would go.

   Output operand expressions must be lvalues; the compiler can check
this.  The input operands need not be lvalues.  The compiler cannot
check whether the operands have data types that are reasonable for the
instruction being executed.  It does not parse the assembler
instruction template and does not know what it means, or whether it is
valid assembler input.  The extended `asm' feature is most often used
for machine instructions that the compiler itself does not know exist.

   The output operands must be write-only; GNU CC will assume that the
values in these operands before the instruction are dead and need not be
generated.  Extended asm does not support input-output or read-write
operands.  For this reason, the constraint character `+', which
indicates such an operand, may not be used.

   When the assembler instruction has a read-write operand, or an
operand in which only some of the bits are to be changed, you must
logically split its function into two separate operands, one input
operand and one write-only output operand.  The connection between them
is expressed by constraints which say they need to be in the same
location when the instruction executes.  You can use the same C
expression for both operands, or different expressions.  For example,
here we write the (fictitious) `combine' instruction with `bar' as its
read-only source operand and `foo' as its read-write destination:

     asm ("combine %2,%0" : "=r" (foo) : "0" (foo), "g" (bar));

The constraint `"0"' for operand 1 says that it must occupy the same
location as operand 0.  A digit in constraint is allowed only in an
input operand, and it must refer to an output operand.

   Only a digit in the constraint can guarantee that one operand will
be in the same place as another.  The mere fact that `foo' is the value
of both operands is not enough to guarantee that they will be in the
same place in the generated assembler code.  The following would not
work:

     asm ("combine %2,%0" : "=r" (foo) : "r" (foo), "g" (bar));

   Various optimizations or reloading could cause operands 0 and 1 to
be in different registers; GNU CC knows no reason not to do so.  For
example, the compiler might find a copy of the value of `foo' in one
register and use it for operand 1, but generate the output operand 0 in
a different register (copying it afterward to `foo''s own address).  Of
course, since the register for operand 1 is not even mentioned in the
assembler code, the result will not work, but GNU CC can't tell that.

   Some instructions clobber specific hard registers.  To describe
this, write a third colon after the input operands, followed by the
names of the clobbered hard registers (given as strings).  Here is a
realistic example for the Vax:

     asm volatile ("movc3 %0,%1,%2"
                   : /* no outputs */
                   : "g" (from), "g" (to), "g" (count)
                   : "r0", "r1", "r2", "r3", "r4", "r5");

   If you refer to a particular hardware register from the assembler
code, then you will probably have to list the register after the third
colon to tell the compiler that the register's value is modified.  In
many assemblers, the register names begin with `%'; to produce one `%'
in the assembler code, you must write `%%' in the input.

   If your assembler instruction can alter the condition code register,
add `cc' to the list of clobbered registers.  GNU CC on some machines
represents the condition codes as a specific hardware register; `cc'
serves to name this register.  On other machines, the condition code is
handled differently, and specifying `cc' has no effect.  But it is
valid no matter what the machine.

   If your assembler instruction modifies memory in an unpredictable
fashion, add `memory' to the list of clobbered registers.  This will
cause GNU CC to not keep memory values cached in registers across the
assembler instruction.

   You can put multiple assembler instructions together in a single
`asm' template, separated either with newlines (written as `\n') or with
semicolons if the assembler allows such semicolons.  The GNU assembler
allows semicolons and all Unix assemblers seem to do so.  The input
operands are guaranteed not to use any of the clobbered registers, and
neither will the output operands' addresses, so you can read and write
the clobbered registers as many times as you like.  Here is an example
of multiple instructions in a template; it assumes that the subroutine
`_foo' accepts arguments in registers 9 and 10:

     asm ("movl %0,r9;movl %1,r10;call _foo"
          : /* no outputs */
          : "g" (from), "g" (to)
          : "r9", "r10");

   Unless an output operand has the `&' constraint modifier, GNU CC may
allocate it in the same register as an unrelated input operand, on the
assumption that the inputs are consumed before the outputs are produced.
This assumption may be false if the assembler code actually consists of
more than one instruction.  In such a case, use `&' for each output
operand that may not overlap an input.  *Note Modifiers::.

   If you want to test the condition code produced by an assembler
instruction, you must include a branch and a label in the `asm'
construct, as follows:

     asm ("clr %0;frob %1;beq 0f;mov #1,%0;0:"
          : "g" (result)
          : "g" (input));

This assumes your assembler supports local labels, as the GNU assembler
and most Unix assemblers do.

   Speaking of labels, jumps from one `asm' to another are not
supported.  The compiler's optimizers do not know about these jumps,
and therefore they cannot take account of them when deciding how to
optimize.

   Usually the most convenient way to use these `asm' instructions is to
encapsulate them in macros that look like functions.  For example,

     #define sin(x)       \
     ({ double __value, __arg = (x);   \
        asm ("fsinx %1,%0": "=f" (__value): "f" (__arg));  \
        __value; })

Here the variable `__arg' is used to make sure that the instruction
operates on a proper `double' value, and to accept only those arguments
`x' which can convert automatically to a `double'.

   Another way to make sure the instruction operates on the correct
data type is to use a cast in the `asm'.  This is different from using a
variable `__arg' in that it converts more different types.  For
example, if the desired type were `int', casting the argument to `int'
would accept a pointer with no complaint, while assigning the argument
to an `int' variable named `__arg' would warn about using a pointer
unless the caller explicitly casts it.

   If an `asm' has output operands, GNU CC assumes for optimization
purposes that the instruction has no side effects except to change the
output operands.  This does not mean that instructions with a side
effect cannot be used, but you must be careful, because the compiler
may eliminate them if the output operands aren't used, or move them out
of loops, or replace two with one if they constitute a common
subexpression.  Also, if your instruction does have a side effect on a
variable that otherwise appears not to change, the old value of the
variable may be reused later if it happens to be found in a register.

   You can prevent an `asm' instruction from being deleted, moved
significantly, or combined, by writing the keyword `volatile' after the
`asm'.  For example:

     #define set_priority(x)  \
     asm volatile ("set_priority %0": /* no outputs */ : "g" (x))

An instruction without output operands will not be deleted or moved
significantly, regardless, unless it is unreachable.

   Note that even a volatile `asm' instruction can be moved in ways
that appear insignificant to the compiler, such as across jump
instructions.  You can't expect a sequence of volatile `asm'
instructions to remain perfectly consecutive.  If you want consecutive
output, use a single `asm'.

   It is a natural idea to look for a way to give access to the
condition code left by the assembler instruction.  However, when we
attempted to implement this, we found no way to make it work reliably.
The problem is that output operands might need reloading, which would
result in additional following "store" instructions.  On most machines,
these instructions would alter the condition code before there was time
to test it.  This problem doesn't arise for ordinary "test" and
"compare" instructions because they don't have any output operands.

   If you are writing a header file that should be includable in ANSI C
programs, write `__asm__' instead of `asm'.  *Note Alternate Keywords::.




Controlling Names Used in Assembler Code
========================================

   You can specify the name to be used in the assembler code for a C
function or variable by writing the `asm' (or `__asm__') keyword after
the declarator as follows:

     int foo asm ("myfoo") = 2;

This specifies that the name to be used for the variable `foo' in the
assembler code should be `myfoo' rather than the usual `_foo'.

   On systems where an underscore is normally prepended to the name of
a C function or variable, this feature allows you to define names for
the linker that do not start with an underscore.

   You cannot use `asm' in this way in a function *definition*; but you
can get the same effect by writing a declaration for the function
before its definition and putting `asm' there, like this:

     extern func () asm ("FUNC");

     func (x, y)
          int x, y;
     ...

   It is up to you to make sure that the assembler names you choose do
not conflict with any other assembler symbols.  Also, you must not use a
register name; that would produce completely invalid assembler code.
GNU CC does not as yet have the ability to store static variables in
registers.  Perhaps that will be added.




Variables in Specified Registers
================================

   GNU C allows you to put a few global variables into specified
hardware registers.  You can also specify the register in which an
ordinary register variable should be allocated.

   * Global register variables reserve registers throughout the program.
     This may be useful in programs such as programming language
     interpreters which have a couple of global variables that are
     accessed very often.

   * Local register variables in specific registers do not reserve the
     registers.  The compiler's data flow analysis is capable of
     determining where the specified registers contain live values, and
     where they are available for other uses.

     These local variables are sometimes convenient for use with the
     extended `asm' feature (*note Extended Asm::.), if you want to
     write one output of the assembler instruction directly into a
     particular register.  (This will work provided the register you
     specify fits the constraints specified for that operand in the
     `asm'.)


Defining Global Register Variables
----------------------------------

   You can define a global register variable in GNU C like this:

     register int *foo asm ("a5");

Here `a5' is the name of the register which should be used.  Choose a
register which is normally saved and restored by function calls on your
machine, so that library routines will not clobber it.

   Naturally the register name is cpu-dependent, so you would need to
conditionalize your program according to cpu type.  The register `a5'
would be a good choice on a 68000 for a variable of pointer type.  On
machines with register windows, be sure to choose a "global" register
that is not affected magically by the function call mechanism.

   In addition, operating systems on one type of cpu may differ in how
they name the registers; then you would need additional conditionals.
For example, some 68000 operating systems call this register `%a5'.

   Eventually there may be a way of asking the compiler to choose a
register automatically, but first we need to figure out how it should
choose and how to enable you to guide the choice.  No solution is
evident.

   Defining a global register variable in a certain register reserves
that register entirely for this use, at least within the current
compilation.  The register will not be allocated for any other purpose
in the functions in the current compilation.  The register will not be
saved and restored by these functions.  Stores into this register are
never deleted even if they would appear to be dead, but references may
be deleted or moved or simplified.

   It is not safe to access the global register variables from signal
handlers, or from more than one thread of control, because the system
library routines may temporarily use the register for other things
(unless you recompile them specially for the task at hand).

   It is not safe for one function that uses a global register variable
to call another such function `foo' by way of a third function `lose'
that was compiled without knowledge of this variable (i.e. in a
different source file in which the variable wasn't declared).  This is
because `lose' might save the register and put some other value there.
For example, you can't expect a global register variable to be
available in the comparison-function that you pass to `qsort', since
`qsort' might have put something else in that register.  (If you are
prepared to recompile `qsort' with the same global register variable,
you can solve this problem.)

   If you want to recompile `qsort' or other source files which do not
actually use your global register variable, so that they will not use
that register for any other purpose, then it suffices to specify the
compiler option `-ffixed-REG'.  You need not actually add a global
register declaration to their source code.

   A function which can alter the value of a global register variable
cannot safely be called from a function compiled without this variable,
because it could clobber the value the caller expects to find there on
return.  Therefore, the function which is the entry point into the part
of the program that uses the global register variable must explicitly
save and restore the value which belongs to its caller.

   On most machines, `longjmp' will restore to each global register
variable the value it had at the time of the `setjmp'.  On some
machines, however, `longjmp' will not change the value of global
register variables.  To be portable, the function that called `setjmp'
should make other arrangements to save the values of the global register
variables, and to restore them in a `longjmp'.  This way, the same
thing will happen regardless of what `longjmp' does.

   All global register variable declarations must precede all function
definitions.  If such a declaration could appear after function
definitions, the declaration would be too late to prevent the register
from being used for other purposes in the preceding functions.

   Global register variables may not have initial values, because an
executable file has no means to supply initial contents for a register.

   On the Sparc, there are reports that g3 ... g7 are suitable
registers, but certain library functions, such as `getwd', as well as
the subroutines for division and remainder, modify g3 and g4.  g1 and
g2 are local temporaries.

   On the 68000, a2 ... a5 should be suitable, as should d2 ... d7.  Of
course, it will not do to use more than a few of those.




Specifying Registers for Local Variables
----------------------------------------

   You can define a local register variable with a specified register
like this:

     register int *foo asm ("a5");

Here `a5' is the name of the register which should be used.  Note that
this is the same syntax used for defining global register variables,
but for a local variable it would appear within a function.

   Naturally the register name is cpu-dependent, but this is not a
problem, since specific registers are most often useful with explicit
assembler instructions (*note Extended Asm::.).  Both of these things
generally require that you conditionalize your program according to cpu
type.

   In addition, operating systems on one type of cpu may differ in how
they name the registers; then you would need additional conditionals.
For example, some 68000 operating systems call this register `%a5'.

   Eventually there may be a way of asking the compiler to choose a
register automatically, but first we need to figure out how it should
choose and how to enable you to guide the choice.  No solution is
evident.

   Defining such a register variable does not reserve the register; it
remains available for other uses in places where flow control determines
the variable's value is not live.  However, these registers are made
unavailable for use in the reload pass.  I would not be surprised if
excessive use of this feature leaves the compiler too few available
registers to compile certain functions.




Alternate Keywords
==================

   The option `-traditional' disables certain keywords; `-ansi'
disables certain others.  This causes trouble when you want to use GNU C
extensions, or ANSI C features, in a general-purpose header file that
should be usable by all programs, including ANSI C programs and
traditional ones.  The keywords `asm', `typeof' and `inline' cannot be
used since they won't work in a program compiled with `-ansi', while
the keywords `const', `volatile', `signed', `typeof' and `inline' won't
work in a program compiled with `-traditional'.

   The way to solve these problems is to put `__' at the beginning and
end of each problematical keyword.  For example, use `__asm__' instead
of `asm', `__const__' instead of `const', and `__inline__' instead of
`inline'.

   Other C compilers won't accept these alternative keywords; if you
want to compile with another compiler, you can define the alternate
keywords as macros to replace them with the customary keywords.  It
looks like this:

     #ifndef __GNUC__
     #define __asm__ asm
     #endif

   `-pedantic' causes warnings for many GNU C extensions.  You can
prevent such warnings within one expression by writing `__extension__'
before the expression.  `__extension__' has no effect aside from this.




Incomplete `enum' Types
=======================

   You can define an `enum' tag without specifying its possible values.
This results in an incomplete type, much like what you get if you write
`struct foo' without describing the elements.  A later declaration
which does specify the possible values completes the type.

   You can't allocate variables or storage using the type while it is
incomplete.  However, you can work with pointers to that type.

   This extension may not be very useful, but it makes the handling of
`enum' more consistent with the way `struct' and `union' are handled.

   This extension is not supported by GNU C++.




Function Names as Strings
=========================

   GNU CC predefines two string variables to be the name of the current
function.  The variable `__FUNCTION__' is the name of the function as
it appears in the source.  The variable `__PRETTY_FUNCTION__' is the
name of the function pretty printed in a language specific fashion.

   These names are always the same in a C function, but in a C++
function they may be different.  For example, this program:

     extern "C" {
     extern int printf (char *, ...);
     }

     class a {
      public:
       sub (int i)
         {
           printf ("__FUNCTION__ = %s\n", __FUNCTION__);
           printf ("__PRETTY_FUNCTION__ = %s\n", __PRETTY_FUNCTION__);
         }
     };

     int
     main (void)
     {
       a ax;
       ax.sub (0);
       return 0;
     }

gives this output:

     __FUNCTION__ = sub
     __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ = int  a::sub (int)




Extensions to the C++ Language
******************************

   The GNU compiler provides these extensions to the C++ language (and
you can also use most of the C language extensions in your C++
programs).  If you want to write code that checks whether these
features are available, you can test for the GNU compiler the same way
as for C programs: check for a predefined macro `__GNUC__'.  You can
also use `__GNUG__' to test specifically for GNU C++ (*note Standard
Predefined Macros: (cpp.info)Standard Predefined.).


Named Return Values in C++
==========================

   GNU C++ extends the function-definition syntax to allow you to
specify a name for the result of a function outside the body of the
definition, in C++ programs:

     TYPE
     FUNCTIONNAME (ARGS) return RESULTNAME;
     {
       ...
       BODY
       ...
     }

   You can use this feature to avoid an extra constructor call when a
function result has a class type.  For example, consider a function
`m', declared as `X v = m ();', whose result is of class `X':

     X
     m ()
     {
       X b;
       b.a = 23;
       return b;
     }

   Although `m' appears to have no arguments, in fact it has one
implicit argument: the address of the return value.  At invocation, the
address of enough space to hold `v' is sent in as the implicit argument.
Then `b' is constructed and its `a' field is set to the value 23.
Finally, a copy constructor (a constructor of the form `X(X&)') is
applied to `b', with the (implicit) return value location as the
target, so that `v' is now bound to the return value.

   But this is wasteful.  The local `b' is declared just to hold
something that will be copied right out.  While a compiler that
combined an "elision" algorithm with interprocedural data flow analysis
could conceivably eliminate all of this, it is much more practical to
allow you to assist the compiler in generating efficient code by
manipulating the return value explicitly, thus avoiding the local
variable and copy constructor altogether.

   Using the extended GNU C++ function-definition syntax, you can avoid
the temporary allocation and copying by naming `r' as your return value
as the outset, and assigning to its `a' field directly:

     X
     m () return r;
     {
       r.a = 23;
     }

The declaration of `r' is a standard, proper declaration, whose effects
are executed *before* any of the body of `m'.

   Functions of this type impose no additional restrictions; in
particular, you can execute `return' statements, or return implicitly by
reaching the end of the function body ("falling off the edge").  Cases
like

     X
     m () return r (23);
     {
       return;
     }

(or even `X m () return r (23); { }') are unambiguous, since the return
value `r' has been initialized in either case.  The following code may
be hard to read, but also works predictably:

     X
     m () return r;
     {
       X b;
       return b;
     }

   The return value slot denoted by `r' is initialized at the outset,
but the statement `return b;' overrides this value.  The compiler deals
with this by destroying `r' (calling the destructor if there is one, or
doing nothing if there is not), and then reinitializing `r' with `b'.

   This extension is provided primarily to help people who use
overloaded operators, where there is a great need to control not just
the arguments, but the return values of functions.  For classes where
the copy constructor incurs a heavy performance penalty (especially in
the common case where there is a quick default constructor), this is a
major savings.  The disadvantage of this extension is that you do not
control when the default constructor for the return value is called: it
is always called at the beginning.


Minimum and Maximum Operators in C++
====================================

   It is very convenient to have operators which return the "minimum"
or the "maximum" of two arguments.  In GNU C++ (but not in GNU C),

`A <? B'
     is the "minimum", returning the smaller of the numeric values A
     and B;

`A >? B'
     is the "maximum", returning the larger of the numeric values A and
     B.

   These operations are not primitive in ordinary C++, since you can
use a macro to return the minimum of two things in C++, as in the
following example.

     #define MIN(X,Y) ((X) < (Y) ? : (X) : (Y))

You might then use `int min = MIN (i, j);' to set MIN to the minimum
value of variables I and J.

   However, side effects in `X' or `Y' may cause unintended behavior.
For example, `MIN (i++, j++)' will fail, incrementing the smaller
counter twice.  A GNU C extension allows you to write safe macros that
avoid this kind of problem (*note Naming an Expression's Type: Naming
Types.).  However, writing `MIN' and `MAX' as macros also forces you to
use function-call notation notation for a fundamental arithmetic
operation.  Using GNU C++ extensions, you can write `int min = i <? j;'
instead.

   Since `<?' and `>?' are built into the compiler, they properly
handle expressions with side-effects;  `int min = i++ <? j++;' works
correctly.




`goto' and Destructors in GNU C++
=================================

   In C++ programs, you can safely use the `goto' statement.  When you
use it to exit a block which contains aggregates requiring destructors,
the destructors will run before the `goto' transfers control.  (In ANSI
C++, `goto' is restricted to targets within the current block.)

   The compiler still forbids using `goto' to *enter* a scope that
requires constructors.




Declarations and Definitions in One Header
==========================================

   C++ object definitions can be quite complex.  In principle, your
source code will need two kinds of things for each object that you use
across more than one source file.  First, you need an "interface"
specification, describing its structure with type declarations and
function prototypes.  Second, you need the "implementation" itself.  It
can be tedious to maintain a separate interface description in a header
file, in parallel to the actual implementation.  It is also dangerous,
since separate interface and implementation definitions may not remain
parallel.

   With GNU C++, you can use a single header file for both purposes.

     *Warning:* The mechanism to specify this is in transition.  For the
     nonce, you must use one of two `#pragma' commands; in a future
     release of GNU C++, an alternative mechanism will make these
     `#pragma' commands unnecessary.

   The header file contains the full definitions, but is marked with
`#pragma interface' in the source code.  This allows the compiler to
use the header file only as an interface specification when ordinary
source files incorporate it with `#include'.  In the single source file
where the full implementation belongs, you can use either a naming
convention or `#pragma implementation' to indicate this alternate use
of the header file.

`#pragma interface'
`#pragma interface "SUBDIR/OBJECTS.h"'
     Use this directive in *header files* that define object classes,
     to save space in most of the object files that use those classes.
     Normally, local copies of certain information (backup copies of
     inline member functions, debugging information, and the internal
     tables that implement virtual functions) must be kept in each
     object file that includes class definitions.  You can use this
     pragma to avoid such duplication.  When a header file containing
     `#pragma interface' is included in a compilation, this auxiliary
     information will not be generated (unless the main input source
     file itself uses `#pragma implementation').  Instead, the object
     files will contain references to be resolved at link time.

     The second form of this directive is useful for the case where you
     have multiple headers with the same name in different directories.
     If you use this form, you must specify the same string to `#pragma
     implementation'.

`#pragma implementation'
`#pragma implementation "OBJECTS.h"'
     Use this pragma in a *main input file*, when you want full output
     from included header files to be generated (and made globally
     visible).  The included header file, in turn, should use `#pragma
     interface'.  Backup copies of inline member functions, debugging
     information, and the internal tables used to implement virtual
     functions are all generated in implementation files.

     If you use `#pragma implementation' with no argument, it applies to
     an include file with the same basename(1) as your source file.
     For example, in `allclass.cc', `#pragma implementation' by itself
     is equivalent to `#pragma implementation "allclass.h"'.

     In versions of GNU C++ prior to 2.6.0 `allclass.h' was treated as
     an implementation file whenever you would include it from
     `allclass.cc' even if you never specified `#pragma
     implementation'.  This was deemed to be more trouble than it was
     worth, however, and disabled.

     If you use an explicit `#pragma implementation', it must appear in
     your source file *before* you include the affected header files.

     Use the string argument if you want a single implementation file to
     include code from multiple header files.  (You must also use
     `#include' to include the header file; `#pragma implementation'
     only specifies how to use the file--it doesn't actually include
     it.)

     There is no way to split up the contents of a single header file
     into multiple implementation files.

   `#pragma implementation' and `#pragma interface' also have an effect
on function inlining.

   If you define a class in a header file marked with `#pragma
interface', the effect on a function defined in that class is similar to
an explicit `extern' declaration--the compiler emits no code at all to
define an independent version of the function.  Its definition is used
only for inlining with its callers.

   Conversely, when you include the same header file in a main source
file that declares it as `#pragma implementation', the compiler emits
code for the function itself; this defines a version of the function
that can be found via pointers (or by callers compiled without
inlining).  If all calls to the function can be inlined, you can avoid
emitting the function by compiling with `-fno-implement-inlines'.  If
any calls were not inlined, you will get linker errors.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1)  A file's "basename" was the name stripped of all leading path
information and of trailing suffixes, such as `.h' or `.C' or `.cc'.




Where's the Template?
=====================

   C++ templates are the first language feature to require more
intelligence from the environment than one usually finds on a UNIX
system.  Somehow the compiler and linker have to make sure that each
template instance occurs exactly once in the executable if it is needed,
and not at all otherwise.  There are two basic approaches to this
problem, which I will refer to as the Borland model and the Cfront
model.

Borland model
     Borland C++ solved the template instantiation problem by adding
     the code equivalent of common blocks to their linker; template
     instances are emitted in each translation unit that uses them, and
     they are collapsed together at run time.  The advantage of this
     model is that the linker only has to consider the object files
     themselves; there is no external complexity to worry about.  This
     disadvantage is that compilation time is increased because the
     template code is being compiled repeatedly.  Code written for this
     model tends to include definitions of all member templates in the
     header file, since they must be seen to be compiled.

Cfront model
     The AT&T C++ translator, Cfront, solved the template instantiation
     problem by creating the notion of a template repository, an
     automatically maintained place where template instances are
     stored.  As individual object files are built, notes are placed in
     the repository to record where templates and potential type
     arguments were seen so that the subsequent instantiation step
     knows where to find them.  At link time, any needed instances are
     generated and linked in.  The advantages of this model are more
     optimal compilation speed and the ability to use the system
     linker; to implement the Borland model a compiler vendor also
     needs to replace the linker.  The disadvantages are vastly
     increased complexity, and thus potential for error; theoretically,
     this should be just as transparent, but in practice it has been
     very difficult to build multiple programs in one directory and one
     program in multiple directories using Cfront.  Code written for
     this model tends to separate definitions of non-inline member
     templates into a separate file, which is magically found by the
     link preprocessor when a template needs to be instantiated.

   Currently, g++ implements neither automatic model.  The g++ team
hopes to have a repository working for 2.7.0.  In the mean time, you
have three options for dealing with template instantiations:

  1. Do nothing.  Pretend g++ does implement automatic instantiation
     management.  Code written for the Borland model will work fine, but
     each translation unit will contain instances of each of the
     templates it uses.  In a large program, this can lead to an
     unacceptable amount of code duplication.

  2. Add `#pragma interface' to all files containing template
     definitions.  For each of these files, add `#pragma implementation
     "FILENAME"' to the top of some `.C' file which `#include's it.
     Then compile everything with -fexternal-templates.  The templates
     will then only be expanded in the translation unit which
     implements them (i.e. has a `#pragma implementation' line for the
     file where they live); all other files will use external
     references.  If you're lucky, everything should work properly.  If
     you get undefined symbol errors, you need to make sure that each
     template instance which is used in the program is used in the file
     which implements that template.  If you don't have any use for a
     particular instance in that file, you can just instantiate it
     explicitly, using the syntax from the latest C++ working paper:

          template class A<int>;
          template ostream& operator << (ostream&, const A<int>&);

     This strategy will work with code written for either model.  If
     you are using code written for the Cfront model, the file
     containing a class template and the file containing its member
     templates should be implemented in the same translation unit.

     A slight variation on this approach is to use the flag
     -falt-external-templates instead; this flag causes template
     instances to be emitted in the translation unit that implements
     the header where they are first instantiated, rather than the one
     which implements the file where the templates are defined.  This
     header must be the same in all translation units, or things are
     likely to break.

     *Note Declarations and Definitions in One Header: C++ Interface,
     for more discussion of these pragmas.

  3. Explicitly instantiate all the template instances you use, and
     compile with -fno-implicit-templates.  This is probably your best
     bet; it may require more knowledge of exactly which templates you
     are using, but it's less mysterious than the previous approach,
     and it doesn't require any `#pragma's or other g++-specific code.
     You can scatter the instantiations throughout your program, you
     can create one big file to do all the instantiations, or you can
     create tiny files like

          #include "Foo.h"
          #include "Foo.cc"

          template class Foo<int>;

     for each instance you need, and create a template instantiation
     library from those.  I'm partial to the last, but your mileage may
     vary.  If you are using Cfront-model code, you can probably get
     away with not using -fno-implicit-templates when compiling files
     that don't `#include' the member template definitions.




Type Abstraction using Signatures
=================================

   In GNU C++, you can use the keyword `signature' to define a
completely abstract class interface as a datatype.  You can connect this
abstraction with actual classes using signature pointers.  If you want
to use signatures, run the GNU compiler with the `-fhandle-signatures'
command-line option.  (With this option, the compiler reserves a second
keyword `sigof' as well, for a future extension.)

   Roughly, signatures are type abstractions or interfaces of classes.
Some other languages have similar facilities.  C++ signatures are
related to ML's signatures, Haskell's type classes, definition modules
in Modula-2, interface modules in Modula-3, abstract types in Emerald,
type modules in Trellis/Owl, categories in Scratchpad II, and types in
POOL-I.  For a more detailed discussion of signatures, see `Signatures:
A C++ Extension for Type Abstraction and Subtype Polymorphism' by
Gerald Baumgartner and Vincent F. Russo (Tech report CSD-TR-93-059,
Dept. of Computer Sciences, Purdue University, September 1993, to
appear in *Software Practice & Experience*).  You can get the tech
report by anonymous FTP from `ftp.cs.purdue.edu' in
`pub/reports/TR93-059.PS.Z'.

   Syntactically, a signature declaration is a collection of member
function declarations and nested type declarations.  For example, this
signature declaration defines a new abstract type `S' with member
functions `int foo ()' and `int bar (int)':

     signature S
     {
       int foo ();
       int bar (int);
     };

   Since signature types do not include implementation definitions, you
cannot write an instance of a signature directly.  Instead, you can
define a pointer to any class that contains the required interfaces as a
"signature pointer".  Such a class "implements" the signature type.

   To use a class as an implementation of `S', you must ensure that the
class has public member functions `int foo ()' and `int bar (int)'.
The class can have other member functions as well, public or not; as
long as it offers what's declared in the signature, it is suitable as
an implementation of that signature type.

   For example, suppose that `C' is a class that meets the requirements
of signature `S' (`C' "conforms to" `S').  Then

     C obj;
     S * p = &obj;

defines a signature pointer `p' and initializes it to point to an
object of type `C'.  The member function call `int i = p->foo ();'
executes `obj.foo ()'.

   Abstract virtual classes provide somewhat similar facilities in
standard C++.  There are two main advantages to using signatures
instead:

  1. Subtyping becomes independent from inheritance.  A class or
     signature type `T' is a subtype of a signature type `S'
     independent of any inheritance hierarchy as long as all the member
     functions declared in `S' are also found in `T'.  So you can
     define a subtype hierarchy that is completely independent from any
     inheritance (implementation) hierarchy, instead of being forced to
     use types that mirror the class inheritance hierarchy.

  2. Signatures allow you to work with existing class hierarchies as
     implementations of a signature type.  If those class hierarchies
     are only available in compiled form, you're out of luck with
     abstract virtual classes, since an abstract virtual class cannot
     be retrofitted on top of existing class hierarchies.  So you would
     be required to write interface classes as subtypes of the abstract
     virtual class.

   There is one more detail about signatures.  A signature declaration
can contain member function *definitions* as well as member function
declarations.  A signature member function with a full definition is
called a *default implementation*; classes need not contain that
particular interface in order to conform.  For example, a class `C' can
conform to the signature

     signature T
     {
       int f (int);
       int f0 () { return f (0); };
     };

whether or not `C' implements the member function `int f0 ()'.  If you
define `C::f0', that definition takes precedence; otherwise, the
default implementation `S::f0' applies.




Known Causes of Trouble with GNU CC
***********************************

   This section describes known problems that affect users of GNU CC.
Most of these are not GNU CC bugs per se--if they were, we would fix
them.  But the result for a user may be like the result of a bug.

   Some of these problems are due to bugs in other software, some are
missing features that are too much work to add, and some are places
where people's opinions differ as to what is best.


Actual Bugs We Haven't Fixed Yet
================================

   * The `fixincludes' script interacts badly with automounters; if the
     directory of system header files is automounted, it tends to be
     unmounted while `fixincludes' is running.  This would seem to be a
     bug in the automounter.  We don't know any good way to work around
     it.

   * The `fixproto' script will sometimes add prototypes for the
     `sigsetjmp' and `siglongjmp' functions that reference the
     `jmp_buf' type before that type is defined.  To work around this,
     edit the offending file and place the typedef in front of the
     prototypes.

   * There are several obscure case of mis-using struct, union, and
     enum tags that are not detected as errors by the compiler.

   * When `-pedantic-errors' is specified, GNU C will incorrectly give
     an error message when a function name is specified in an expression
     involving the comma operator.

   * Loop unrolling doesn't work properly for certain C++ programs.
     This is a bug in the C++ front end.  It sometimes emits incorrect
     debug info, and the loop unrolling code is unable to recover from
     this error.




Installation Problems
=====================

   This is a list of problems (and some apparent problems which don't
really mean anything is wrong) that show up during installation of GNU
CC.

   * On certain systems, defining certain environment variables such as
     `CC' can interfere with the functioning of `make'.

   * If you encounter seemingly strange errors when trying to build the
     compiler in a directory other than the source directory, it could
     be because you have previously configured the compiler in the
     source directory.  Make sure you have done all the necessary
     preparations.  *Note Other Dir::.

   * If you build GNU CC on a BSD system using a directory stored in a
     System V file system, problems may occur in running `fixincludes'
     if the System V file system doesn't support symbolic links.  These
     problems result in a failure to fix the declaration of `size_t' in
     `sys/types.h'.  If you find that `size_t' is a signed type and
     that type mismatches occur, this could be the cause.

     The solution is not to use such a directory for building GNU CC.

   * In previous versions of GNU CC, the `gcc' driver program looked for
     `as' and `ld' in various places; for example, in files beginning
     with `/usr/local/lib/gcc-'.  GNU CC version 2 looks for them in
     the directory `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/TARGET/VERSION'.

     Thus, to use a version of `as' or `ld' that is not the system
     default, for example `gas' or GNU `ld', you must put them in that
     directory (or make links to them from that directory).

   * Some commands executed when making the compiler may fail (return a
     non-zero status) and be ignored by `make'.  These failures, which
     are often due to files that were not found, are expected, and can
     safely be ignored.

   * It is normal to have warnings in compiling certain files about
     unreachable code and about enumeration type clashes.  These files'
     names begin with `insn-'.  Also, `real.c' may get some warnings
     that you can ignore.

   * Sometimes `make' recompiles parts of the compiler when installing
     the compiler.  In one case, this was traced down to a bug in
     `make'.  Either ignore the problem or switch to GNU Make.

   * If you have installed a program known as purify, you may find that
     it causes errors while linking `enquire', which is part of building
     GNU CC.  The fix is to get rid of the file `real-ld' which purify
     installs--so that GNU CC won't try to use it.

   * On Linux SLS 1.01, there is a problem with `libc.a': it does not
     contain the obstack functions.  However, GNU CC assumes that the
     obstack functions are in `libc.a' when it is the GNU C library.
     To work around this problem, change the `__GNU_LIBRARY__'
     conditional around line 31 to `#if 1'.

   * On some 386 systems, building the compiler never finishes because
     `enquire' hangs due to a hardware problem in the motherboard--it
     reports floating point exceptions to the kernel incorrectly.  You
     can install GNU CC except for `float.h' by patching out the
     command to run `enquire'.  You may also be able to fix the problem
     for real by getting a replacement motherboard.  This problem was
     observed in Revision E of the Micronics motherboard, and is fixed
     in Revision F.  It has also been observed in the MYLEX MXA-33
     motherboard.

     If you encounter this problem, you may also want to consider
     removing the FPU from the socket during the compilation.
     Alternatively, if you are running SCO Unix, you can reboot and
     force the FPU to be ignored.  To do this, type `hd(40)unix auto
     ignorefpu'.

   * On some 386 systems, GNU CC crashes trying to compile `enquire.c'.
     This happens on machines that don't have a 387 FPU chip.  On 386
     machines, the system kernel is supposed to emulate the 387 when you
     don't have one.  The crash is due to a bug in the emulator.

     One of these systems is the Unix from Interactive Systems: 386/ix.
     On this system, an alternate emulator is provided, and it does
     work.  To use it, execute this command as super-user:

          ln /etc/emulator.rel1 /etc/emulator

     and then reboot the system.  (The default emulator file remains
     present under the name `emulator.dflt'.)

     Try using `/etc/emulator.att', if you have such a problem on the
     SCO system.

     Another system which has this problem is Esix.  We don't know
     whether it has an alternate emulator that works.

     On NetBSD 0.8, a similar problem manifests itself as these error
     messages:

          enquire.c: In function `fprop':
          enquire.c:2328: floating overflow

   * On SCO systems, when compiling GNU CC with the system's compiler,
     do not use `-O'.  Some versions of the system's compiler miscompile
     GNU CC with `-O'.

   * Sometimes on a Sun 4 you may observe a crash in the program
     `genflags' or `genoutput' while building GNU CC.  This is said to
     be due to a bug in `sh'.  You can probably get around it by running
     `genflags' or `genoutput' manually and then retrying the `make'.

   * On Solaris 2, executables of GNU CC version 2.0.2 are commonly
     available, but they have a bug that shows up when compiling current
     versions of GNU CC: undefined symbol errors occur during assembly
     if you use `-g'.

     The solution is to compile the current version of GNU CC without
     `-g'.  That makes a working compiler which you can use to recompile
     with `-g'.

   * Solaris 2 comes with a number of optional OS packages.  Some of
     these packages are needed to use GNU CC fully.  If you did not
     install all optional packages when installing Solaris, you will
     need to verify that the packages that GNU CC needs are installed.

     To check whether an optional package is installed, use the
     `pkginfo' command.  To add an optional package, use the `pkgadd'
     command.  For further details, see the Solaris documentation.

     For Solaris 2.0 and 2.1, GNU CC needs six packages: `SUNWarc',
     `SUNWbtool', `SUNWesu', `SUNWhea', `SUNWlibm', and `SUNWtoo'.

     For Solaris 2.2, GNU CC needs an additional seventh package:
     `SUNWsprot'.

   * On Solaris 2, trying to use the linker and other tools in
     `/usr/ucb' to install GNU CC has been observed to cause trouble.
     For example, the linker may hang indefinitely.  The fix is to
     remove `/usr/ucb' from your `PATH'.

   * If you use the 1.31 version of the MIPS assembler (such as was
     shipped with Ultrix 3.1), you will need to use the
     -fno-delayed-branch switch when optimizing floating point code.
     Otherwise, the assembler will complain when the GCC compiler fills
     a branch delay slot with a floating point instruction, such as
     `add.d'.

   * If on a MIPS system you get an error message saying "does not have
     gp sections for all it's [sic] sectons [sic]", don't worry about
     it.  This happens whenever you use GAS with the MIPS linker, but
     there is not really anything wrong, and it is okay to use the
     output file.  You can stop such warnings by installing the GNU
     linker.

     It would be nice to extend GAS to produce the gp tables, but they
     are optional, and there should not be a warning about their
     absence.

   * In Ultrix 4.0 on the MIPS machine, `stdio.h' does not work with GNU
     CC at all unless it has been fixed with `fixincludes'.  This causes
     problems in building GNU CC.  Once GNU CC is installed, the
     problems go away.

     To work around this problem, when making the stage 1 compiler,
     specify this option to Make:

          GCC_FOR_TARGET="./xgcc -B./ -I./include"

     When making stage 2 and stage 3, specify this option:

          CFLAGS="-g -I./include"

   * Users have reported some problems with version 2.0 of the MIPS
     compiler tools that were shipped with Ultrix 4.1.  Version 2.10
     which came with Ultrix 4.2 seems to work fine.

     Users have also reported some problems with version 2.20 of the
     MIPS compiler tools that were shipped with RISC/os 4.x.  The
     earlier version 2.11 seems to work fine.

   * Some versions of the MIPS linker will issue an assertion failure
     when linking code that uses `alloca' against shared libraries on
     RISC-OS 5.0, and DEC's OSF/1 systems.  This is a bug in the
     linker, that is supposed to be fixed in future revisions.  To
     protect against this, GNU CC passes `-non_shared' to the linker
     unless you pass an explicit `-shared' or `-call_shared' switch.

   * On System V release 3, you may get this error message while
     linking:

          ld fatal: failed to write symbol name SOMETHING
           in strings table for file WHATEVER

     This probably indicates that the disk is full or your ULIMIT won't
     allow the file to be as large as it needs to be.

     This problem can also result because the kernel parameter `MAXUMEM'
     is too small.  If so, you must regenerate the kernel and make the
     value much larger.  The default value is reported to be 1024; a
     value of 32768 is said to work.  Smaller values may also work.

   * On System V, if you get an error like this,

          /usr/local/lib/bison.simple: In function `yyparse':
          /usr/local/lib/bison.simple:625: virtual memory exhausted

     that too indicates a problem with disk space, ULIMIT, or `MAXUMEM'.

   * Current GNU CC versions probably do not work on version 2 of the
     NeXT operating system.

   * On NeXTStep 3.0, the Objective C compiler does not work, due,
     apparently, to a kernel bug that it happens to trigger.  This
     problem does not happen on 3.1.

   * On the Tower models 4N0 and 6N0, by default a process is not
     allowed to have more than one megabyte of memory.  GNU CC cannot
     compile itself (or many other programs) with `-O' in that much
     memory.

     To solve this problem, reconfigure the kernel adding the following
     line to the configuration file:

          MAXUMEM = 4096

   * On HP 9000 series 300 or 400 running HP-UX release 8.0, there is a
     bug in the assembler that must be fixed before GNU CC can be
     built.  This bug manifests itself during the first stage of
     compilation, while building `libgcc2.a':

          _floatdisf
          cc1: warning: `-g' option not supported on this version of GCC
          cc1: warning: `-g1' option not supported on this version of
GCC
          ./xgcc: Internal compiler error: program as got fatal signal
11

     A patched version of the assembler is available by anonymous ftp
     from `altdorf.ai.mit.edu' as the file
     `archive/cph/hpux-8.0-assembler'.  If you have HP software support,
     the patch can also be obtained directly from HP, as described in
     the following note:

          This is the patched assembler, to patch SR#1653-010439, where
          the assembler aborts on floating point constants.

          The bug is not really in the assembler, but in the shared
          library version of the function "cvtnum(3c)".  The bug on
          "cvtnum(3c)" is SR#4701-078451.  Anyway, the attached
          assembler uses the archive library version of "cvtnum(3c)"
          and thus does not exhibit the bug.

     This patch is also known as PHCO_4484.

   * On HP-UX version 8.05, but not on 8.07 or more recent versions,
     the `fixproto' shell script triggers a bug in the system shell.
     If you encounter this problem, upgrade your operating system or
     use BASH (the GNU shell) to run `fixproto'.

   * Some versions of the Pyramid C compiler are reported to be unable
     to compile GNU CC.  You must use an older version of GNU CC for
     bootstrapping.  One indication of this problem is if you get a
     crash when GNU CC compiles the function `muldi3' in file
     `libgcc2.c'.

     You may be able to succeed by getting GNU CC version 1, installing
     it, and using it to compile GNU CC version 2.  The bug in the
     Pyramid C compiler does not seem to affect GNU CC version 1.

   * There may be similar problems on System V Release 3.1 on 386
     systems.

   * On the Intel Paragon (an i860 machine), if you are using operating
     system version 1.0, you will get warnings or errors about
     redefinition of `va_arg' when you build GNU CC.

     If this happens, then you need to link most programs with the
     library `iclib.a'.  You must also modify `stdio.h' as follows:
     before the lines

          #if     defined(__i860__) && !defined(_VA_LIST)
          #include <va_list.h>

     insert the line

          #if __PGC__

     and after the lines

          extern int  vprintf(const char *, va_list );
          extern int  vsprintf(char *, const char *, va_list );
          #endif

     insert the line

          #endif /* __PGC__ */

     These problems don't exist in operating system version 1.1.

   * On the Altos 3068, programs compiled with GNU CC won't work unless
     you fix a kernel bug.  This happens using system versions V.2.2
     1.0gT1 and V.2.2 1.0e and perhaps later versions as well.  See the
     file `README.ALTOS'.

   * You will get several sorts of compilation and linking errors on the
     we32k if you don't follow the special instructions.  *Note
     Configurations::.

   * A bug in the HP-UX 8.05 (and earlier) shell will cause the fixproto
     program to report an error of the form:

          ./fixproto: sh internal 1K buffer overflow

     To fix this, change the first line of the fixproto script to look
     like:

          #!/bin/ksh




Cross-Compiler Problems
=======================

   You may run into problems with cross compilation on certain machines,
for several reasons.

   * Cross compilation can run into trouble for certain machines because
     some target machines' assemblers require floating point numbers to
     be written as *integer* constants in certain contexts.

     The compiler writes these integer constants by examining the
     floating point value as an integer and printing that integer,
     because this is simple to write and independent of the details of
     the floating point representation.  But this does not work if the
     compiler is running on a different machine with an incompatible
     floating point format, or even a different byte-ordering.

     In addition, correct constant folding of floating point values
     requires representing them in the target machine's format.  (The C
     standard does not quite require this, but in practice it is the
     only way to win.)

     It is now possible to overcome these problems by defining macros
     such as `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.  But doing so is a substantial amount of
     work for each target machine.  *Note Cross-compilation::.

   * At present, the program `mips-tfile' which adds debug support to
     object files on MIPS systems does not work in a cross compile
     environment.




Interoperation
==============

   This section lists various difficulties encountered in using GNU C or
GNU C++ together with other compilers or with the assemblers, linkers,
libraries and debuggers on certain systems.

   * Objective C does not work on the RS/6000.

   * GNU C++ does not do name mangling in the same way as other C++
     compilers.  This means that object files compiled with one compiler
     cannot be used with another.

     This effect is intentional, to protect you from more subtle
     problems.  Compilers differ as to many internal details of C++
     implementation, including: how class instances are laid out, how
     multiple inheritance is implemented, and how virtual function
     calls are handled.  If the name encoding were made the same, your
     programs would link against libraries provided from other
     compilers--but the programs would then crash when run.
     Incompatible libraries are then detected at link time, rather than
     at run time.

   * Older GDB versions sometimes fail to read the output of GNU CC
     version 2.  If you have trouble, get GDB version 4.4 or later.

   * DBX rejects some files produced by GNU CC, though it accepts
     similar constructs in output from PCC.  Until someone can supply a
     coherent description of what is valid DBX input and what is not,
     there is nothing I can do about these problems.  You are on your
     own.

   * The GNU assembler (GAS) does not support PIC.  To generate PIC
     code, you must use some other assembler, such as `/bin/as'.

   * On some BSD systems, including some versions of Ultrix, use of
     profiling causes static variable destructors (currently used only
     in C++) not to be run.

   * Use of `-I/usr/include' may cause trouble.

     Many systems come with header files that won't work with GNU CC
     unless corrected by `fixincludes'.  The corrected header files go
     in a new directory; GNU CC searches this directory before
     `/usr/include'.  If you use `-I/usr/include', this tells GNU CC to
     search `/usr/include' earlier on, before the corrected headers.
     The result is that you get the uncorrected header files.

     Instead, you should use these options (when compiling C programs):

          -I/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/TARGET/VERSION/include -I/usr/include

     For C++ programs, GNU CC also uses a special directory that
     defines C++ interfaces to standard C subroutines.  This directory
     is meant to be searched *before* other standard include
     directories, so that it takes precedence.  If you are compiling
     C++ programs and specifying include directories explicitly, use
     this option first, then the two options above:

          -I/usr/local/lib/g++-include

   * On some SGI systems, when you use `-lgl_s' as an option, it gets
     translated magically to `-lgl_s -lX11_s -lc_s'.  Naturally, this
     does not happen when you use GNU CC.  You must specify all three
     options explicitly.

   * On a Sparc, GNU CC aligns all values of type `double' on an 8-byte
     boundary, and it expects every `double' to be so aligned.  The Sun
     compiler usually gives `double' values 8-byte alignment, with one
     exception: function arguments of type `double' may not be aligned.

     As a result, if a function compiled with Sun CC takes the address
     of an argument of type `double' and passes this pointer of type
     `double *' to a function compiled with GNU CC, dereferencing the
     pointer may cause a fatal signal.

     One way to solve this problem is to compile your entire program
     with GNU CC.  Another solution is to modify the function that is
     compiled with Sun CC to copy the argument into a local variable;
     local variables are always properly aligned.  A third solution is
     to modify the function that uses the pointer to dereference it via
     the following function `access_double' instead of directly with
     `*':

          inline double
          access_double (double *unaligned_ptr)
          {
            union d2i { double d; int i[2]; };

            union d2i *p = (union d2i *) unaligned_ptr;
            union d2i u;

            u.i[0] = p->i[0];
            u.i[1] = p->i[1];

            return u.d;
          }

     Storing into the pointer can be done likewise with the same union.

   * On Solaris, the `malloc' function in the `libmalloc.a' library may
     allocate memory that is only 4 byte aligned.  Since GNU CC on the
     Sparc assumes that doubles are 8 byte aligned, this may result in a
     fatal signal if doubles are stored in memory allocated by the
     `libmalloc.a' library.

     The solution is to not use the `libmalloc.a' library.  Use instead
     `malloc' and related functions from `libc.a'; they do not have
     this problem.

   * Sun forgot to include a static version of `libdl.a' with some
     versions of SunOS (mainly 4.1).  This results in undefined symbols
     when linking static binaries (that is, if you use `-static').  If
     you see undefined symbols `_dlclose', `_dlsym' or `_dlopen' when
     linking, compile and link against the file `mit/util/misc/dlsym.c'
     from the MIT version of X windows.

   * The 128-bit long double format that the Sparc port supports
     currently works by using the architecturally defined quad-word
     floating point instructions.  Since there is no hardware that
     supports these instructions they must be emulated by the operating
     system.  Long doubles do not work in Sun OS versions 4.0.3 and
     earlier, because the kernel eumulator uses an obsolete and
     incompatible format.  Long doubles do not work in Sun OS versions
     4.1.1 to 4.1.3 because of emululator bugs that cause random
     unpredicatable failures.  Long doubles appear to work in Sun OS 5.x
     (Solaris 2.x).

   * On HP-UX version 9.01 on the HP PA, the HP compiler `cc' does not
     compile GNU CC correctly.  We do not yet know why.  However, GNU CC
     compiled on earlier HP-UX versions works properly on HP-UX 9.01
     and can compile itself properly on 9.01.

   * On the HP PA machine, ADB sometimes fails to work on functions
     compiled with GNU CC.  Specifically, it fails to work on functions
     that use `alloca' or variable-size arrays.  This is because GNU CC
     doesn't generate HP-UX unwind descriptors for such functions.  It
     may even be impossible to generate them.

   * Debugging (`-g') is not supported on the HP PA machine, unless you
     use the preliminary GNU tools (*note Installation::.).

   * Taking the address of a label may generate errors from the HP-UX
     PA assembler.  GAS for the PA does not have this problem.

   * Using floating point parameters for indirect calls to static
     functions will not work when using the HP assembler.  There simply
     is no way for GCC to specify what registers hold arguments for
     static functions when using the HP assembler.  GAS for the PA does
     not have this problem.

   * For some very large functions you may receive errors from the HP
     linker complaining about an out of bounds unconditional branch
     offset.  Fixing this problem correctly requires fixing problems in
     GNU CC and GAS.  We hope to fix this in time for GNU CC 2.6.
     Until then you can work around by making your function smaller,
     and if you are using GAS, splitting the function into multiple
     source files may be necessary.

   * GNU CC compiled code sometimes emits warnings from the HP-UX
     assembler of the form:

          (warning) Use of GR3 when
            frame >= 8192 may cause conflict.

     These warnings are harmless and can be safely ignored.

   * The current version of the assembler (`/bin/as') for the RS/6000
     has certain problems that prevent the `-g' option in GCC from
     working.  Note that `Makefile.in' uses `-g' by default when
     compiling `libgcc2.c'.

     IBM has produced a fixed version of the assembler.  The upgraded
     assembler unfortunately was not included in any of the AIX 3.2
     update PTF releases (3.2.2, 3.2.3, or 3.2.3e).  Users of AIX 3.1
     should request PTF U403044 from IBM and users of AIX 3.2 should
     request PTF U416277.  See the file `README.RS6000' for more
     details on these updates.

     You can test for the presense of a fixed assembler by using the
     command

          as -u < /dev/null

     If the command exits normally, the assembler fix already is
     installed.  If the assembler complains that "-u" is an unknown
     flag, you need to order the fix.

   * On the IBM RS/6000, compiling code of the form

          extern int foo;

          ... foo ...

          static int foo;

     will cause the linker to report an undefined symbol `foo'.
     Although this behavior differs from most other systems, it is not a
     bug because redefining an `extern' variable as `static' is
     undefined in ANSI C.

   * AIX on the RS/6000 provides support (NLS) for environments outside
     of the United States.  Compilers and assemblers use NLS to support
     locale-specific representations of various objects including
     floating-point numbers ("." vs "," for separating decimal
     fractions).  There have been problems reported where the library
     linked with GCC does not produce the same floating-point formats
     that the assembler accepts.  If you have this problem, set the
     LANG environment variable to "C" or "En_US".

   * Even if you specify `-fdollars-in-identifiers', you cannot
     successfully use `$' in identifiers on the RS/6000 due to a
     restriction in the IBM assembler.  GAS supports these identifiers.

   * On the RS/6000, XLC version 1.3.0.0 will miscompile `jump.c'.  XLC
     version 1.3.0.1 or later fixes this problem.  You can obtain
     XLC-1.3.0.2 by requesting PTF 421749 from IBM.

   * There is an assembler bug in versions of DG/UX prior to 5.4.2.01
     that occurs when the `fldcr' instruction is used.  GNU CC uses
     `fldcr' on the 88100 to serialize volatile memory references.  Use
     the option `-mno-serialize-volatile' if your version of the
     assembler has this bug.

   * On VMS, GAS versions 1.38.1 and earlier may cause spurious warning
     messages from the linker.  These warning messages complain of
     mismatched psect attributes.  You can ignore them.  *Note VMS
     Install::.

   * On NewsOS version 3, if you include both of the files `stddef.h'
     and `sys/types.h', you get an error because there are two typedefs
     of `size_t'.  You should change `sys/types.h' by adding these
     lines around the definition of `size_t':

          #ifndef _SIZE_T
          #define _SIZE_T
          ACTUAL TYPEDEF HERE
          #endif

   * On the Alliant, the system's own convention for returning
     structures and unions is unusual, and is not compatible with GNU
     CC no matter what options are used.

   * On the IBM RT PC, the MetaWare HighC compiler (hc) uses a different
     convention for structure and union returning.  Use the option
     `-mhc-struct-return' to tell GNU CC to use a convention compatible
     with it.

   * On Ultrix, the Fortran compiler expects registers 2 through 5 to
     be saved by function calls.  However, the C compiler uses
     conventions compatible with BSD Unix: registers 2 through 5 may be
     clobbered by function calls.

     GNU CC uses the same convention as the Ultrix C compiler.  You can
     use these options to produce code compatible with the Fortran
     compiler:

          -fcall-saved-r2 -fcall-saved-r3 -fcall-saved-r4 -fcall-saved-
r5

   * On the WE32k, you may find that programs compiled with GNU CC do
     not work with the standard shared C ilbrary.  You may need to link
     with the ordinary C compiler.  If you do so, you must specify the
     following options:

          -L/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/we32k-att-sysv/2.6.0 -lgcc -lc_s

     The first specifies where to find the library `libgcc.a' specified
     with the `-lgcc' option.

     GNU CC does linking by invoking `ld', just as `cc' does, and there
     is no reason why it *should* matter which compilation program you
     use to invoke `ld'.  If someone tracks this problem down, it can
     probably be fixed easily.

   * On the Alpha, you may get assembler errors about invalid syntax as
     a result of floating point constants.  This is due to a bug in the
     C library functions `ecvt', `fcvt' and `gcvt'.  Given valid
     floating point numbers, they sometimes print `NaN'.

   * On Irix 4.0.5F (and perhaps in some other versions), an assembler
     bug sometimes reorders instructions incorrectly when optimization
     is turned on.  If you think this may be happening to you, try
     using the GNU assembler; GAS version 2.1 supports ECOFF on Irix.

     Or use the `-noasmopt' option when you compile GNU CC with itself,
     and then again when you compile your program.  (This is a temporary
     kludge to turn off assembler optimization on Irix.)  If this
     proves to be what you need, edit the assembler spec in the file
     `specs' so that it unconditionally passes `-O0' to the assembler,
     and never passes `-O2' or `-O3'.


Reporting Bugs
**************

   Your bug reports play an essential role in making GNU CC reliable.

   When you encounter a problem, the first thing to do is to see if it
is already known.  *Note Trouble::.  If it isn't known, then you should
report the problem.

   Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem,
or it may not.  (If it does not, look in the service directory; see
*Note Service::.)  In any case, the principal function of a bug report
is to help the entire community by making the next version of GNU CC
work better.  Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of
GNU CC.

   Since the maintainers are very overloaded, we cannot respond to every
bug report.  However, if the bug has not been fixed, we are likely to
send you a patch and ask you to tell us whether it works.

   In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that makes for fixing the bug.


Have You Found a Bug?
=====================

   If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some
guidelines:

   * If the compiler gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that
     is a compiler bug.  Reliable compilers never crash.

   * If the compiler produces invalid assembly code, for any input
     whatever (except an `asm' statement), that is a compiler bug,
     unless the compiler reports errors (not just warnings) which would
     ordinarily prevent the assembler from being run.

   * If the compiler produces valid assembly code that does not
     correctly execute the input source code, that is a compiler bug.

     However, you must double-check to make sure, because you may have
     run into an incompatibility between GNU C and traditional C (*note
     Incompatibilities::.).  These incompatibilities might be considered
     bugs, but they are inescapable consequences of valuable features.

     Or you may have a program whose behavior is undefined, which
     happened by chance to give the desired results with another C or
     C++ compiler.

     For example, in many nonoptimizing compilers, you can write `x;'
     at the end of a function instead of `return x;', with the same
     results.  But the value of the function is undefined if `return'
     is omitted; it is not a bug when GNU CC produces different results.

     Problems often result from expressions with two increment
     operators, as in `f (*p++, *p++)'.  Your previous compiler might
     have interpreted that expression the way you intended; GNU CC might
     interpret it another way.  Neither compiler is wrong.  The bug is
     in your code.

     After you have localized the error to a single source line, it
     should be easy to check for these things.  If your program is
     correct and well defined, you have found a compiler bug.

   * If the compiler produces an error message for valid input, that is
     a compiler bug.

   * If the compiler does not produce an error message for invalid
     input, that is a compiler bug.  However, you should note that your
     idea of "invalid input" might be my idea of "an extension" or
     "support for traditional practice".

   * If you are an experienced user of C or C++ compilers, your
     suggestions for improvement of GNU CC or GNU C++ are welcome in
     any case.




Where to Report Bugs
====================

   Send bug reports for GNU C to `bug-gcc@prep.ai.mit.edu'.

   Send bug reports for GNU C++ to `bug-g++@prep.ai.mit.edu'.  If your
bug involves the C++ class library libg++, send mail to
`bug-lib-g++@prep.ai.mit.edu'.  If you're not sure, you can send the
bug report to both lists.

   *Do not send bug reports to `help-gcc@prep.ai.mit.edu' or to the
newsgroup `gnu.gcc.help'.* Most users of GNU CC do not want to receive
bug reports.  Those that do, have asked to be on `bug-gcc' and/or
`bug-g++'.

   The mailing lists `bug-gcc' and `bug-g++' both have newsgroups which
serve as repeaters: `gnu.gcc.bug' and `gnu.g++.bug'.  Each mailing list
and its newsgroup carry exactly the same messages.

   Often people think of posting bug reports to the newsgroup instead of
mailing them.  This appears to work, but it has one problem which can be
crucial: a newsgroup posting does not contain a mail path back to the
sender.  Thus, if maintainers need more information, they may be unable
to reach you.  For this reason, you should always send bug reports by
mail to the proper mailing list.

   As a last resort, send bug reports on paper to:
