I assume that you have installed Psy-Q and the C compiler correctly
as documented in the readme file on the PSX distribution disks.
The following assumes that you have the DEXBIOS.COM TSR program
correctly installed in your PC (e.g. in your autoexec)

Not that the fileserver functions will perform much better if the
DEXBIOS command line includes a correct IRQ number.

e.g. DEXBIOS /aXXX /i15



DBUGPSX command line:-


Syntax:-

  DBUGPSX </switches> <filename> <filename>...

fields enclosed <thus> are optional and can be in any order
filenames specify symbol files, default extension (.SYM) will be
added.

valid switches are:-

  &expr<,..> comma seperated list of parameter expressions
  c-         turn case sensitivity off (see also c+)
  efile      (filename optional) load CPE file into target
  h          halt target at debugger startup
  i###       specify update interval (in 1/18ths sec)
  l#         set label level (0 to 4)
  m+         force debugger to use official mouse driver
  r##        (No. optional) override video bios data screen rows
  sfile      override default setup file
  t#         set target ID No. (default is 7)
  u-         turn continual update mode off (see also u+)
  vexprtext  evaluate exprtext and put result to stdout
  x-         force debugger to run in real (not 386 protected) mode



KEYS THAT FUNCTION IN ALL WINDOWS:-

shift arrow	change current window (move to window in that
		direction).

F1		change current window. As above.

F2		move a window edge (to re-size windows)

F3		create new window (splits current window in two)

F4		Delete a window edge (merge two adjoining windows)

F7		STEP. If current window is source or disassembly then
		it will track the PC location. Works by placing
		a temporary breakpoint at next instruction.

F8		STEP OVER. This will step over the current
		instruction. If it is a JAL or BAL instruction this
		will cause the whole subroutine to be executed.

F9		RUN target. Starts the target CPU executing at the
		current PC location.

F10		Select MENU mode (from keyboard as opposed to mouse)

ESC		Stop the target program.

SHIFT-ESC	Stop the target program & halt interrupts. (DANGER!)

shift-f1	set current window to specified type.

shift-f5	clear all breakpoints

shift-f6	reset all breakpoint counts

shift-f8	put breakpoint after current instruction and run.

shift-f9	run to (prompted for) address.

shift-f10	force debugger to reload config file

alt-U		toggle debugger window continous update on/off.
		I normally have this on but it does slow the target
		cpu slightly.

alt-I		set time interval (in 18th's second) for ditto updates)
		(target scan interval if updates are off).

alt-L		lock current window start to specified expression.
		e.g. I like to lock a tall narrow HEX window to 'sp'
		so that I can always see the current stack.

ctrl-L		temporarily toggle window lock active/inactive.


ctrl-S		save all cpu registers to temporary buffer

ctrl-R		restore all cpu registers from temporary buffer

alt-H		Hex Calc. Evaluate assembler type expression.


ctrl-F2		Reload & reset executable file (if one was specified
		on the debugger command line). Not recommended on PSX
		because of the pad_start() pad_stop() problem.


alt-V		display debugger Version information.

alt-X		eXit the debugger (saving debugger context)

/		force update of current window even if continual
		update mode is off.

*		force full screen update & redraw.


ctrl-X		eXit debugger without saving debugger config.


ctrl-F		Fill memory range with specified value.

ctrl-Z		Temporarily ZOOM current window to full screen.
		ctrl-Z again to return to window'ed mode.

alt-P		Print current window to LPT1

alt-NUM		instantly switch debugger config (including screen layout)
		to one of ten screens. (all context preserved at each
		switch)


MEMORY WINDOW SPECIFICS:-

alt-F		follow longword pointer at cursor.

<return>	enter expression to change value of location under
		cursor

0-9 A-F a-f	directly modify memory at cursor location

arrow keys	move cursor

pg-up pd-down	window up or down by one window-full

alt-W		toggle window display to bytes/words/longwords

+		increment memory location under cursor

-		decrement memory location under cursor

alt-G		move window to display at specified address

alt-S		search memory range for specified bytes/words/longs
		or ASCII text

alt-N		continue previous search.


DISASSEMBLY WINDOW SPECIFICS:-

alt-S		Search memory for specified instruction text

alt-N		continue ditto.

ctrl-D		disassemble memory range to a text file

left, right	adjust window start address

up, down	move cursor

pg-up, pg-down	as you'd expect

alt-G		Goto specified address

tab		Goto PC

shift-tab	Set PC to current cursor location

F5		toggle breakpoint at cursor

F6		run to cursor (temp breakpoint at cursor addr)

ctrl-C		attach trigger count to breakpoint at cursor

alt-C		attach trigger condition (expression) to breakpoint

<return>	single line assembler (not in PSX version yet)


REGISTER WINDOW SPECIFICS:-

left right
up down		move cursor

0-9 A-F a-f	modify register under cursor

<return>	enter new value (expression) for register under cursor


WATCH WINDOW SPECIFICS:-

up down		move cursor

insert		insert new watch at cursor posn

del		delete watch at cursor position

+		Open up structure display (if selected watch
		expression is a structure.) This does not currently
		handle pointers to structures, just structures.
		This will improve with the new C expression
		evaluator.

-		Close ditto



VAR WINDOW SPECIFICS:-

as WATCH window but you cannot INSert or DELete in this window.



FILE WINDOW SPECIFICS:-

pg-up pg-down
up down		move cursor

<enter>		display new text file

alt-S		search for text

alt-N		continue ditto

alt-T		set tabs for current file in current window

tab		locate to PC address

shift-tab	set PC to address of source line under cursor.


f7		step current source line

f8		step over current source line

f5		toggle breakpoint at cursor

f6		run until cursor

alt-G		goto address (prompts for expression)

alt-L		goto Line No of current file.


Message windows:

These display buffered text information from a specific debugger
back-channel stream. The target writes text to a back channel stream
by preforming a fileserver write to a negative file handle. -1 for
first window, -2 for next etc.

These streams are buffered by the PC even when the debugger is not
running.

See fileserver PCwrite() in LIBSN.H for further details.



VAR WINDOWS:

Display the variables which correspond to the current scope.
This is usually the local variables of the current function.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

An example of the debugger in action:-

1) Change to the directory containing the BALLS example program

2) CCPSX -v -g -Xo$80010000 main.c -omain.cpe,main.sym

3) DBUGPSX main /e

This runs the debugger and loads the symbol file MAIN.SYM and loads
the executable image of the same name (MAIN.CPE).


By default the debugger will display two windows. Register window
(top) and disassembly window (bottom).

Press F3. Press UP arrow. This will create a new window.

Press shift-F1. Select Hex (press H or click with mouse).
This will make the current window a Hex window

Press shift-UP-arrow to move to the other (disassembly) window.

Press TAB to display the current PC if it is not already there.

Press F7 to step one instruction. F8 will step over subroutine calls.

Press alt-G, enter 'main<return>' in response to prompt.

Press F6 to run until the cursor address (start of function main)

PC is now in a region which the debugger has Source Info for so now
you can go to source level mode:-

Press shift-F1 and select File window. Just hit return in response to
the prompt for a filename. Now press TAB in the empty file window.
This will locate the source file line corresponding to the PC.

Now you can F7 and F8 to step your source code.

Press F9 to just run the program. Notice that the source code
contains a pollhost() function call. (SEE LIBSN.H)
This allows the debugger to access the PSX memory and cpu even
though the user application is running. Your code should always have
a pollhost() somewhere active if you wish to access the target whilst
it is running.

You may also want to try creating more windows using F3 and re-sizing
them using F2. Delete window edges using F4 etc. Notice that these
are the same keys used by Brief to manipulate windows.

Notice that if you create a VAR window it will display the variables
curently in scope (or globals if there is no current scope). The
scope will change as you step into and out of different functions.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

FILESERVER FUNCTIONS:-

The fileserver allows you to access the PC filing system from the PSX
to load data files to memory and also to write files on the PC filing
system and to access the Psy-Q debug back-channel to display debug
messages in debugger windows.

Don't forget to #include <libsn.h>   if you wish to use these
functions.

Here are the prototypes for the functions in LIBSN:-


/*
** LIBSN.H	declare libary functions provided by LIBSN.LIB
**
** 05/02/94 ADB
** 21/03/94	ADB	added user notes as comments
** 18/09/94 ADB	added PCcreat() - it was missing before
*/

#define	pollhost()	asm("break 1024")	/* inline to keep variable scope */


/*
** FILESERVER FUNCTIONS:
**
** NOTE: For PCread and PCwrite do not load files by passing extreme
** values for count as you might on UNIX as this will cause the full
** amount specified to be transferred - the file will be padded to
** that length with zeroes which may over-write memory beyond the
** end of the file.
**
** If you are unsure of the length of a file which you are about
** to read into memory then perform a
** 	len = PClseek( fd, 0, 2);
** This will set len to the length of the file which you can then
** pass to a PCread() function call.
**
*/

/*
** re-initialise PC filing system, close open files etc
**
** passed: void
**
** return: error code (0 if no error)
*/
int	PCinit (void);

/*
** open a file on PC host
**
** passed:	PC file pathname, open mode, permission flags
**
** return:	file-handle or -1 if error

int	PCcreat (char *name, int perms);

*/
int	PClseek (int fd, int offset, int mode);

/*
** read bytes from file on PC
**

*/
int	PCclose (int fd);
