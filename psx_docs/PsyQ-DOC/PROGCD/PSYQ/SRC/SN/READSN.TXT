COMPILER PATHS & STANDARD LIBRARY INFORMATION
---------------------------------------------

You *MUST* have a valid PSYQ_PATH environment variable. This variable
should point to the directory containing PSYQ.INI

If you use CCPSX to compile you no longer require the environment
variables for compiler paths and library files but you must put this
information into your PSYQ.INI file instead. Please check this
PSYQ.INI file now as your compiler and library paths may differ from
ours.

THE NEW MESSAGE WINDOW for PSX printf() output
----------------------------------------------

Some developers complained that printf() output received by DBUGPSX
was too slow and had too small a buffer. To fix this I have
implemented a character based (rather than block) message stream
which is much faster and makes better use of buffer space. The new
system also allows you to override the default buffer size.

   Unlike the original message handler this version is designed to
   handle single character I/O as produced by PSX printf().

   Because it is designed for a single character stream it makes much
   more efficient use of buffer space. A full 4K characters can be
   buffered by default. Other buffer sizes can be specified on the
   command line up to a max of 65534 bytes (but see notes below).

The debugger now auto-detects which message system is being used and
takes input from either the new one or the old one.


To use the printf() facility you must have installed a PSX STDOUT
handler on the PC. The standard STDOUT handler is MESS1.COM
There are no longer default message facilities in DEXBIOS or PSYBIOS.
By seperating this into two programs we can make more efficient use
of PC memory. If you install DEXBIOS but do not install MESS?.COM
then stdout from PSX will be discarded by the PC.

To confirm that new stdout to PC is working correctly you can execute
the following:-

	RESETPS 1
	RUN MAIN
	TESTMESS

If all is working correctly you should see the text output from the
main program scrolling up your PC screen. Press a key to exit.

That's all there is to it. You now have a larger buffer and a snappier
response for your printf() output.


Additional notes:
=================

Note that for message support you must have the second TSR MESS1.COM
installed in your PC.

MESS1 allows an optional command line parameter to specify buffer
size. If no size is specified then the default is to use a 4K buffer.
Be warned that if you increase the buffer size then you will consume
more DOS memory.

If you use QEMM then you should re-run the QEMM OPTIMIZE program if
you update the TSRs or adjust the buffer size.

PSYBIOS no longer ocntains message buffering code. Instead it will
detect MESS1 and forward messages to that program if it is installed.

The combined size of MESS1 and PSYBIOS is actually less than the old
PSYBIOS.

MESS1 is optional. If you do not install MESS1 then PSYBIOS will
still function correctly but it will discard any messages received
from the target. MESS1 is not required for normal PC fileserver
operation.

DBUGPSX now does not poll for messages unless there is a mesage
window on the screen.

DEXBIOS 1.22 now does not check for DOS re-entrancy on message writes
as this is only necessary for genuine fileserver writes. This means
that your PSX printf() output does not slow down if Brief is running.

For help on the DELAY program enter DELAY /?

  DELAY program for DOS (from SN Systems Ltd)
  Syntax:
     delay <count>
  Count is seconds/18, default is .5 seconds.


MESS3.COM - message handler to divert output to PC serial port
==============================================================

This alternative version may be handy if you have a spare laptop PC
or Unix workstation (!?) sat around near you development machine.  It
also works quite well with a Psion Series 3 + serial adapter. It
sounds a bit silly to use another machine just for character output
but there has been quite a demand for this as it means you can see
the printf() output even if you aren't running the PSX debugger.

MESS3 works just like MESS1 but instead of making message output
available to the debugger it sends the messages back out of the
serial port. Unlike the old MW3 serial output this method will not
hold up the PSX whilst serial output is happening because the
characters are buffered by MESS3 and sent out of the PC serial port
in the background using a serial port interrupt.

Any strange individuals who are considering tying together 2 PC
serial ports and using Windows terminal to monitor PSX output may
prefer to wait for the upcoming Windows version of MESS1 which will
not require any serial ports.

Note that if PSX printf() sends data faster than the serial port can
transfer it then the PC buffer will fill up and eventually you will
lose characters when it overflows. This problem is more noticeable
with slower baud-rate settings.

Default settings (i.e. MESS3 with no parameters) are to use a 4K
buffer and direct output to COM2 (IRQ 3) at 9600 Baud.

   Psy-Q RS232 output Message Server TSR ver 3.01
   Syntax:
     mess1 <switches> <buffsize> <switches>
   
     Buffsize is in Kbytes, default is 4K
   
   valid switches are:-
     b##    set baud rate (first 2 characters of baud rate)
     c#     set COM port (1,2,3 or 4)
     i#     override default IRQ number (0 to 7)

e.g. MESS3 /b19200 /c1

Sets the TSR to re-direct output to COM1 at 19200 baud.

Note that the baud rate specification needs only specify the first
two characters - the rest are ignored. Also note that if you have a
serial port with a non-standard IRQ (as long as it is 0 to 7) you can
also override the default IRQ setting for that COM port.

e.g. MESS3 /b11 /c3 /i5

causes output to be sent to COM3 (i.e. port address 3E8) at 115 Kbaud
using IRQ 5. A standard COM3 would have used IRQ 4 (same as COM1).


IF IT DOESN'T WORK
==================

1) if you do not get any message text at all then check:-

   a) that you haven't run the NOPRINT module fro SCEJ
   b) that you really have installed the correct version of
      DEXBIOS and that you have the MESS1 tsr loaded.

   c) If you install PATCHX in a batch file then see next section.

2) If it works but is slow (18cps) then you have an IRQ problem:-

   a) you have not specified the DTL-H interrupt on DEXBIOS cmdline
or b) the DTL-H IRQ is in use by another card or IRQ handler.
or c) you have not set the IRQ jumper on the DTL-H card correctly
or d) on a PCI local-bus PC you may need to use BIOS set-up program
      to select the IRQ as for ISA bus rather than PCI
or e) the IRQ on your DTL-H board is faulty.

Note: Please try MESS1.COM first as this will allow you to be sure
that the PSX side of the set-up is working. MESS3.COM also requires
that you specify the serial parameters correctly.


PROBLEMS USING PATCHX
=====================

This is really nothing to do with this update but I'm mentioning it
here because printf() can show the symptoms of this problem:-

The PATCHX kernel update may be unstable for a very short while
after it is installed. Even though PATCHX may have appear to have
completed execution OK, if you connect to the PSX during this short
period of instability it seems that certain kernel functions may not
initialise correctly. Printf() output is one of the things which may
not work if the kernel does not start-up undisturbed.

This problem seems to be caused by cache coherency problems in the
current version of PATCHX. Some people have attempted to insert
delays into their batch file to work around the problem. This is
flaky at best and a better solution is to obtain the SNPATCH
replacement for PATCHX from SONY. SNPATCH has the added advantage
that it updates your debug stub code (to 4.03) at the same time.
Note that 4.03 is necessary if you wish to have a polhost call in a
callback.
