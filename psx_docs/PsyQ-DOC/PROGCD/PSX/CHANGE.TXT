Known Bugs and Cautions
=========================================================================
  In libsnd, where a noise sound source such as SEQ is used , a noise may 
  be produced at an unexpected place.  Thus if you want to use a noise, 
  please use libspu/libsnd functions directly on the programmer 
  tool(PC) or use sampled noise and treat it as the same way 
  as the waveform.

  In libgs, dividing GsSortObject4J lower functions using GsA4div 
  will not reflect the TMD translucent information set in "attribute".
  If you want to use the translucent attribute, the translucent 
  flag of the TMD data must be set ON.	
  
  In libcd, CdlSetloc must be issued to determine the reading 
  position before issuing CdRead().  Without setting the reading 
  position, repeating the CdRead()may fail to read in the right 
  amount of data.	
 
  In libspu SpuSetVoiceAttr()/SpuGetVoiceAttr(), the correct pitch value cannot be
  set/obtained by using sample_note or note.  The value will contain considerably 
  large errors.  In order to set/obtain the correct pitch, use the "pitch" attribute.

  In libgun, the vertical direction counter value stored into the buffer is the system clock value
  and is cleared at every H-BLANK.  Thus correct the value to reflect the  screen size 
  before actual use. 






Samples Modified and Added 
==========================================================================
CD
======
  \PSX\SAMPLE\CD\TUTO\TUTO1.C now complies with the new CD swapping
  specification. Please refer to the document "Imperative Steps for Title 
   Consisting of Multiple CDs",  BBS released from SCEI and

                psx\doc\jp\word\overview\cd.doc

SCEA\CNTRL
=========
  SCEA\CNTRL: Demonstrates usage of the various controller
  API's.  This was shown at the autumn SCEA developer's conference in 1996.
  The program automatically recognizes what controllers are attached to
  the controller ports -- pads, light guns, steering wheels, and
  mice.


Graphics
============
\PSX\SAMPLE\GRAPHICS\ROTATE\AXESMIME : Axis Interpolation MIME sample 

\PSX\SAMPLE\GRAPHICS\CLUTFOG\TUTO3 : Texture Depth Queuing by DR_LOAD
						sample 

Sound
=========
\PSX\SAMPLE\SOUND\SIMPLE\JUMP: FSEQ Play by Jump Table sample


Document: Directory Structure, Modifications, and Changes
=======================================================================
(For Japanese only)
For this version, the new document in HTML format is added.
Please use Netscape 3.0 or later, Internet Explorer 3.0 or later to 
browse it.

Note, with this change, document directory structure was changed as
follows;

	PSX--DOC--JP---HTML-LIBREF
                     |   |
                     |   ---OVERVIEW
                     |
                     --TEXT-LIBREF
                     |   |
                     |   ---OVERVIEW
                     |
                     --WORD-LIBREF
                         |
                         ---OVERVIEW

The documents, "abstract.txt" & "appendix.txt" and "function.txt" & "struct.txt" 
that were previously under "TEXT" were merged into "OVERVIEW" and "LIBREF"
respectively.

   
   (e.g.)..TEXT\GPU\ABSTRACT.TXT, APPENDIX.TXTÅ®..TEXT\OVERVIEW\GPU.TXT
       ..TEXT\GPU\FUNCTION.TXT, STRUCT.TXTÅ®..TEXT\LIBREF\GPU.TXT


The size of the argument, "result"(8 bytes) was added to the CdReadSync () explanation.

An incorrect specification of CdGetSector() was corrected in the "Library Reference".

The bit explanation of GsSPRITE member, "attribute", was enhanced.

Type 2 instruction mapping table for C header files(inlin_c.h, inline_o.h) 
  and Assemble header file(inline_a.h) and explanation of Type 2 instruction with
  and without "nop" was added to dmpsx abstract.txt 	  

  GsDefDispBuff () explanation was modified.
   Wrong default values for the double buffer (0,0), (0, y_res) was 
   corrected to (0,0), (0,0).


Serial Input/Output Library (libsio)
======================================================================

This is a newly available library from this release 3.6.
This is a library to perform standard I/O between PC and PS using the communication
cable DTL-H3050.
Since the standard I/O of the debugging station is set to NULL normally, no debug 
information can be obtained.
By using this library, libsio, standard I/O can be allocated to the PS communication port, and
by connecting the communication cable DTL-H3050, RS232C I/O is enabled.

Available Functions

        AddSIO            	Registers SIO Driver
        DelSIO  		Delete SIO Driver
        _sio_control	BIOS Interface for SIO Driver


Kernel Library(libapi)
=========================================================

Renamed Function
==================
In C++, the function "delete" releases memory that was allocated by 
the "new" function.  Unfortunately, this "delete" conflicts with the
libapi function, "delete()", and causes compiler errors.  To avoid 
these compiler errors, the libapi function "delete()" has been changed 
to "erase()".



Malloc.obj deleted
========================

The functions included in the "malloc.obj" file have been moved into
libapi.lib, and the names of those functions have been changed
to malloc2(), free2(), realloc2(), InitHeap2(), calloc2(), free2().
"malloc.obj" has been deleted from this release.



Functions Added
==================

InitHeap2       	Initializes Heap Area
      Syntax  	void InitHeap2( head, size )
                	void *head;
                	long size;
      Arguments 	
		head           Heap start address
            size            Heap size ( multiple of 4, in bytes)
        	
	Explanation    
		This function initializes a group of standard function library
		memory control functions.  After using this function, malloc2(), etc.
		are usable.

		There is an overhead so the entire "size" in bytes cannot be used.
		
		This is the bug fix version of InitHeap() but causes a larger program size
		since this is a memory resident function.   		
      Return Value  
		None
      Remarks    	
		If several executions of this function overlap, the memory control
		information previously held will be lost. 
      Related Functions 
		InitHeap(),malloc2(),realloc2(),calloc2(),free2()
	

malloc2         Allocates main memory

    	Syntax 	#include <stdlib.h>
                	void *malloc2(size_t s)

    	Explanation  
		This function allocates "s" bytes of memory block from  
		the heap memory.
       
		Corresponds to InitHeap2().

    	Return Value      
		Returns a pointer to allocated memory block.
          	If failed, NULL is returned.
           	*Heap memory is defined as below;

           	Low Address            Module Highest Address + 4
           	High Address           On-board memory - 64KB

    	Related Function    
		calloc2(),realloc2(),free2()


realloc2        	Changes the heap memory allocation

    	Syntax     	#include <stdlib.h>
                		void *realloc2(void *block, size_t s)

    	Explanation        
		This function increases/decreases the size of the memory block 
		previously allocated to "s" bytes. 
		Same as malloc2 when block is NULL.
		Corresponds to InitHeap2().
		
    	Return Value      
		Returns a pointer to the reallocated memory block.
		The new pointer may have different address from the
		original.
           	If reallocation fails, NULL will be returned, and 
		the original block will not be released.
		
    	Related Function   
		calloc2(),malloc2(),free2()


calloc2         	Allocates main memory

    	Syntax 	#include <stdlib.h>
                	void *calloc2( size_t n, size_t s )

    	Argument    	n      	Number of partitions
                		s       	Size of one partition

    	Explanation   	
		This function allocates a block of n*s bytes.
            Corresponds to InitHeap2().

    	Return Value    
		Returns a pointer to the allocated memory block.
		If the allocation fails, NULL will be returned.	

    	Related Function  
		malloc2(),realloc2(),free2()



free2           	Frees allocated memory blocks

    	Syntax 	#include <stdlib.h>
                	void free2(void *block)
			
    	Explanation 	
		This function releases a memory block that was allocated by
		calloc2,malloc2, and realloc2.
            Corresponds to InitHeap2().

    	Return Value  
		None

    	Related Function  	
		calloc2(),malloc2(),realloc2()




DMPSX
===========================================================

Library Version Update
============================
DMPSX has been upgraded for GTE specification disclosure.

	DMPSX version 2.06 -> version 3.01

Please read "psx\doc\jp\text\overview\dmpsx.txt" for detail.


Header File Changes
============================
Type 2 instruction without "nop" have been added to "inline_c.h".
This instruction has the name "gte_rtps_b", "_b" added to the original 
type 2 instruction name "gte_rtps", and "nop" is deleted.  

	(Example)
		gte_rtps()  ->  gte_rtps_b()

DMPSX gives errors and will not convert when there are cop2 instructions 
in 2 slots prior to the type 2 instructions.  Thus when using type 2 instructions 
without nop in the program, make sure to place instruction (e.g. CPU instruction) 
other than cop2.  


CD-ROM Library/Streaming Library (libcd)
======================================================

Header File Changes
=====================
The prototype declaration for CdReset() has been added to "libcd.h" as follows;

		int CdReset(int mode);

A duplication of the StFreeRing() prototype declaration has been fixed.


Function Deleted
=====================
The primitive command CdlReset has been deleted.  

When resetting CD subsystem, be sure to use the following function;

	int CdReset(int mode)
	
When using the above function, internal variables used in the library
will not be updated.  For this reason,  any function that follows may not be 
invoked correctly.    Affected functions currently known are as below;

	CdMode()
	CdLastCom()

Although CdGetSector() was remarked as a NON-BLOCKING in the earlier 	
version of library reference manual, it actually is a BLOCKING 
function.  Since the data transfer completes upon returning from a 
function, you do not need to use CdDataSync() or CdDataCallback() to 
determine transfer of data has been completed.


Command Added
===================
The following commands are added to libcd;

	CdlGetTN      	Obtains number of TOC entries
     	CdlGetTD        	Obtains TOC 

Refer to the document "overview/cd.doc" for command details.


Functions Modified
===================
CdGetDiskType() now complies with the new CD swapping specification.
  
  Please refer to the document "Imperative Steps for Title Consisting of Multiple CDs",
  BBS released from SCEI,
                psx\doc\jp\word\overview\cd.doc,
  and the sample program,
                psx\sample\cd\tuto\tuto11.c.
  
Combat Cable Library(libcomb)
=========================================================


Official Version
===================
"libcomb", which was located in the Runtime Library Release 3.5 beta version as \beta\comb.lzh, is 
now officially released in this version.




Basic Graphics library(libgpu)
==============================

Bug Fixes in Library
===========================
- The bug that all characters specified in KanjiFntOpen() are not displayed
   in KanjiFntPrint() when attempting to display many characters has been fixed.

- The bug that ResetGraph(3) did not operate has been fixed.
  (Already fixed in Release 3.5)

- The bug that ClearImage() for texture pages (other than Drawing Area) 
  only clears either odd or even lines has been fixed.
 
- Although the drawing environment was reset within the library upon 
  restarting drawing by ContinueDraw in the previous releases,    
  it now does not reset due to the following bug:
  Upon execution of drawing setting related primitive(such as DR_ENV),
  suspending the drawing by BreakDraw and then restart by ContinueDraw fails to
  set the correct drawing settings. 
  
  If the drawing environment for the primitives to be inserted and the primitive
  to be continued are different, add the primitive that resets the drawing 
  environment at the end of the primitive to be inserted.   
  
  Although the drawing is suspended by BreakDraw, GPU will not stop
  until the drawing is completed. 

  The new function, IsIdleGPU was added to check if the drawing
  suspended by BreakDraw has been completed or not.

- In MargePrim() for checking the maximum packet size, the tag that 
  the error return value -1 was not returned even when the packet size
  exceeds its max, 16-word(including the tag), has been fixed.


Function Added
======================
IsIdleGPU   Checks if the drawing once suspended by BreakDraw
		was completed

        	Syntax  		int IsIdleGPU(int maxcount)

        	Argument    	
		maxcount        Count value

        	Explanation    
		 Although drawing is suspended by BreakDraw, GPU will not stop
 		until the drawing is completed. 

		Thus this function checks if the drawing suspended by BreakDraw
		has been completed or not.  If GPU will not be an idle state within 
		the time given by maxcount, -1 will be returned.

        	Return Value  
		 0:      	GPU is in idle state
           	-1:     	GPU is in drawing state


Functions Added
====================
- Mode for GPU initializing has been added to GsInitGraph() called "intl".
  (Please see the description of the "GsInitGraph" in the "Header File Changes"
   section below -- [Ed.] ) 

Extended Graphics Library(libgs)
=======================================

Bug Fixes in Library
=================
- In GsLinkObject4 and GsSortObject4, the bug that the gradation square 
  polygon with light source calculation was not displayed has been fixed. 	  
  With this fix, two new members are added to "_GsFCALL" structure in 
  "libgs.h".  Please be careful when initializing a jump table. 
   
- In GsLinkObject4 and GsSortObject4,  the bug that the gradation square 
  translucent polygon with light source calculation was displayed as opaque
  has been fixed. 
  

Header File Changes
=======================
In GsSortClear(), a prototype declaration duplication had been removed.



Functions Added
===================
GsInitGraph	Graphics System Initialization

	Syntax	
		void GsInitGraph(ix_res, y_res, intl, dither, vram)
		int x_res;
		int y_res;
		int intl;
		int dither;
		int vram;

	Argument
		x_res	Horizontal Resolution (256/320/384/512/640)
		y_res	Vertical Resolution (240/480)
		intl	Interlace Display Flag(bit 0)
				0: Non-interlace	GsNONINTER
			    	1: Interlace	GSINTER

			Double buffer offset mode(bit 2)
			    0:  GTE Offset		GsOFSGTE
			    1:  GPU Offset		GsOFSGPU

			GPU Initialize Parameter(bit 4-5)
			    0:  ResetGraph(0)		GsRESET0
			    3:  ResetGraph(3)  		GsRESET3
		dither	Dithering processing flag
			0: OFF 
			1: ON
		vram:	VRAM mode
			0: 16bit 
			1: 24bit

	Explanation	
		Resets "libgpu" and initializes "libgs" graphic system.
		"libgpu" settings are accessed by a global variables, GsDISPENV, and
		GsDRAWENV.  Thus the programmer can verify and/or modify 
		"libgpu" by referencing these variables.      
  								  
		Vertical 480 line non-interlace mode is effective only when a 
		VGA monitor is connected.

		WARNING: The top and bottom 8 lines are  almost invisible on 
		typical home-use TV monitors when the vertical
		resolution line mode is set to 240. 

		For PAL mode, display position should be shifted down by 24 lines.

		Double buffer offset mode determines whether   
		GTE or GPU offset mode is used .  When the GPU is used, the packet 
		does not include offset values,  and thus is easier to be process. 
		
		For 24 bit mode, only the memory image display is available ;
		therefore, polygon drawing cannot be performed. 
 
		Since initializing the graphic system involves initialization of  
		GsIDMATRIX and GsIDMATRIX2 as well, GsInitGraph() must be called
		prior to all other Gs library functions for correct operation.  
		
	Return Value  
		None

		Low level function group of GsSortObject4J()
            Need to be registered into GsFCALL4 as a low level function 
		before using.

        	This function performs mip-map, texture switching based 
		on the polygon size , to the flat texture squares included in
		the TMD data.

		Locate the texture on the V-RAM as below;

Bug Fixes in Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the RotMeshPrimS_FCT3 function, setting the 
"len" member of the TMESH structure to an odd number would cause a bug.
All sides of such a mesh would be displayed in reverse, except for the first side.
This bug has been fixed.

Gun Library (libgun)
================================

Renamed Functions
=====================
The following functions were renamed to avoid duplicate definition errors during
  linking.
 
        InitGUN         <-      InitGun,InitPAD
        StartGUN        <-      StartPAD
        StopGUN         <-      StopPAD
        SelectGUN       <-      SelectGun

  Previous InitGun and InitPAD functions were merged into
  one function, InitGUN, and the same arguments for InitGun and
  InitPAD are used.  A new function RemoveGUN was added 
  in order to completely remove the gun driver when 
  a child process is used in LoadExec and the like.
 
Data Processing Library (libpress)
=================================================

Bug Fixes in Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We fixed the following bug...If you set non-zero value by DecDCTvlcSize(),
DecDCTvlc() broke some part of memory area.(The NEWS version library is free 
from this bug.)

Functions Added
=====================
dmy_Ss....	Jump Table Low Level Function Dummy
       Syntax    
		void dmy_Ss...()
       Argument    
		None
       Explanation    
		When this function is called for the first time, it outputs the entry
		name of the jump table to the standard output device.  
	
		Use this as a dummy low level function and to determine 
		which entry was called.

----------------------------------------------------------------
SsSeqOpenJ	Opens SEQ data.(Function Table version)
      Syntax    
        	short           SsSeqOpenJ (unsigned long* addr, short vab_id)
      Argument  
	        	addr            Start address of SEQ data in the main memory
	        	vab_id          VAB id
      Explanation
		This function is equivalent to SsSeqOpen() if all the low level functions 
		were registered.  In addition to the SsSeqOpen() capability, this function
		enables a programmer to control functions to be registered to the table and
		thus improve code efficiency by not calling unnecessary low level functions. 
		
 		For those slots that SsFCALL will not register, use dummy 
		functions, standard function names with the prefix "dmy" 
		so that even when a lower function was called, no BUS ERROR
		would occur and the function names would be printed out.
		After checking the called function names, register the 
		function names without "dmy". 
		
       Return Value
        	SEQ Access Number: Used in the SEQ data access function,
        	being the inner SEQ data control table number.
                                   
       	Related External Variable
              	SsFCALL		Function table that SsSeqOpenJ() refers.

----------------------------------------------------------------
SsSepOpenJ	Opens SEP data.(Function Table version)
       	Syntax
              	short  	SsSepOpenJ (unsigned long* addr, short vab_id,
			    	short num2)
        	Argument
                	addr  	Start address of SEQ data in the main memory
                	vab_id  	VAB id
	        	num2   	Number of SEQs contained in SEP
       	Explanation
              	This function is equivalent to SsSepOpen() if all the low level functions 
		were registered.  In addition to the SsSepOpen() capability, this function
		enables a programmer to control functions to be registered to the table and
		thus improve code efficiency by not calling unnecessary low level functions. 
		
 		For those slots that SsFCALL will not register, use dummy 
		functions, standard function names with the prefix "dmy" 
		so that even when a lower function was called, no BUS ERROR
		would occur and the function names would be printed out.
		After checking the called function names, register the
		function names without "dmy". 	
		
        Return Value
	       	SEQ Access Number: Used in the SEQ data access function,
	       	being the inner SEQ data control table number.
		
        Related External Variable
                	SsFCALL		Function table that SsSepOpenJ() refers.

----------------------------------------------------------------
_SsFCALL	Function table type referenced in SsSeqOpenJ() and SsSepOpenJ()

	Structure
		typedef struct {
	        	void (*noteon) ();
		        void (*programchange) ();
			void (*pitchbend) ();
			void (*metaevent) ();
		        void (*control[13]) ();
		        void (*ccentry[20]) ();
		} _SsFCALL;

	Member
	        All members hold pointers to the low level functions.

	        noteon, programchanghe, pitchbend, 
		metaevent, control, ccentry		MIDI status data
	        control array 			Events of MIDI status data  
	                                               control change
	        ccentry array			Entry events for nrpn, rpn data

	Explanation
	 	Functions SsSeqPlay() and SsSepPlay() analyze the MIDI 
		status data and call low level functions.  Although there are 
		many low level functions, an application would not usually
 		use all the functions.  These low level function groups will    
		be set by calling either SsSeqOpen() or SsSepOpen().
		In order to reduce the code size by not linking unnecessary
		low level functions, new functions SsSeqOpenJ() and SsSepOpenJ(),
		compatible with SsSeqOpen() and SsSepOpen() respectively.
		In the new functions,  low level functions are in the jump
		table so that the user can set only desired function group. 
				
	       _SsFCALL is a structure that defines this function table.
	       
		Necessary functions can be linked by assigning the pointer to
		the low level function.  In reverse, link can be eliminated by
		not assigning pointer and not placing extern declaration.
		Note that calling a function without setting a pointer will cause
		BUS ERROR.  To avoid BUS ERROR, set a dummy function by 
		prefixing the low level function name with "dmy".

Basic Sound Library (libspu)
====================================

Changes in Header File
==============================
	libspu.h: Deleted not used structure, SpuVolume16.


Bug Fix in Library
==============================
- When libspu was used alone, reverb could not be specified unless some
  area was allocated by SpuInitMalloc().
  In this release, this bug has been fixed. 

- In SpuGetVoiceAttr(), the bug that an incorrect value was returned depending
  on ADSR MODE, A, S, and R has been fixed.  	

- In SpuWrite0() now returns correct values as in the spec.


Changes in Structure
============================
- A member, low_priority was added to the structure, SpuStEnv.
  Setting SPU_ON to low_priority lower the streaming process priority. 
  The default value is SPU_OFF (do not lower the priority).


Function Added
==============================
