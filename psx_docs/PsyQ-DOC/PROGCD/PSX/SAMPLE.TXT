$PSDocId: Document Release 1.0 for Runtime Library Release 3.6$

PS-X Library Samples Directory                          October 16 1996

Please read the individual readme_e.txt files where applicable in each 
sample directory for additional details for the specific sample.  Some of
these files are still being translated and will be released in the near
future.  Please check the BBS for new updates.

This document contains the following: 

	- a tutorial on how to run the samples
	- a listing of all sample programs available in 
	  the directory "psx\sample\"
	- a brief synopsis of all of the sample programs.

If you are new to PlayStation programming, first run the brief tutorials
below.  Afterwards, you should build the samples in the "tuto" (short for 
"tutorial") directories,  such as \psx\sample\graphics\tuto and 
\psx\sample\sound\tuto.  

If you are an experienced PlayStation programmer, note that some
new samples have been created:

	psx\sample\dongle
	psx\sample\graphics\clutfog\tuto3.c
	psx\sample\mipmap
	psx\sample\rotate\axesmime

Two new directories of samples have been added.

      - psx\sample\scee (fomerly released under the "Dsupport" directory in CDROM 1.7)
      contains samples contributed to and by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe.
     
      - psx\sample\scea samples from Sony Computer
      Entertainment America.  Naturally, in the future, we hope to
      enlarge this.
  




---------------------------------------
Example: How to run a sample program
---------------------------------------
1. Your boards should already have been installed.  

	 -DTL-H2000 users should read "\docs\technote\2000.doc" in the 
   	  Technical Reference CD-ROM.
  
	 -DTL-H2500 users should read "\docs\technote\2500.doc" in the 
	  Technical Reference CD-ROM. Other documents that should be read in
	  conjunction with the installation are

		\docs\technote\decicons.doc
		\docs\technote\flashbat.doc
		\docs\technote\h25bios.doc

2. Make sure the appropriate drivers are running on your system.
	
	- DTL-H2000 users should be running the "dexbios" in their
	  autoexec.bat.  For more information, refer to the document
	  \docs\technote\2000.doc in the Technical Reference CD-ROM.

	- DTL-H2500 users should run the program "h25bios.com" at an MS-DOS
	  command-line prompt.   Drivers such as "h25drv.exe" and "dexbios.com"
	  should NOT be running.   At an MS-DOS command line prompt, type
			
			h25bios.com
	  
	  This loads the TSR into memory.  If you are running from Windows 95,
	  you should run h25bios.com in EACH MS-DOS window in which you 
	  will be compiling and running your programs.
        
	  For more information on h25bios.com, refer to the documents 
	  \docs\technote\2500.doc and  \docs\technote\h25bios.doc
	  in the Technical Reference CD-ROM.
	 
2. Make sure the following path environment variables are valid:

		PSYQ_PATH
		COMPILER_PATH
		PSX_PATH
		C_INCLUDE_PATH
		C_PLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
		LIBRARY_PATH
		GO32
		GO32TMP
		TMPDIR
    
   If not, then you will have trouble compiling and running programs.
   Refer to the documents  refer to the documents  \docs\technote\2500.doc 
   or \docs\technote\2000.doc.

3. Make sure your paths are pointing to the directories "psx\bin" and "psyq".
   If you don't have enough environment space, edit your config.sys

			shell=command.com /E:1024 /p

   to allocate more memory for the environment.  The "/E:1024" sets the 
   environment size to 1024 (valid ranges are from 160 to 32768), and
   "/p" makes this command.com the default command prompt. (See page 342
   of "Peter Norton's Complete Guide to DOS 6.22 6th edition for further
   details.  Or consult your favorite DOS manual.)

3. Make sure the Psy-Q security dongle is in place on PC's parallel 
   printer port.  WARNING: Do not connect any peripherals to the back
   of the security dongle. Although it was meant to be a pass through 
   device, the dongle may be damaged when connect to certain devices,
   such as an external parallel-interface SCSI hard disk.

4. Type the following:

		cd <parent-directory>\psx\sample\graphics\clutfog
		psymake 
   
   The GNU-C compiler will produce (among other things) "tuto0.cpe",
   which is a PlayStation binary file.
  
5. Reset the board by typing

		resetps 1


6. If (and only if) you are running the DTL-H2000 board, type the following:

		run <parent-dir>\psyq\snpatch.cpe

   The file "snapatch.cpe" fixes a bug in the ROM of the DTL-H2000 board.
   DTL-H2500 users must not run this patch. 

7. Load the "tim" files  into the main memory of the development board by
   typing 
	
		psymake load

   "Tim" files are written in a format usable by the GPU library functions.
    Examine the file "makefile.mak".  The "load" directive invokes the function
   "pqbload", which loads the specified binary data into the memory address
   (in hexadecimal notation) of the PlayStation's main memory.   Routines
   within the code will transfer the data from the main memory to the video
   RAM.

6.  Run the program.  Type 

		run tuto0.cpe

   This loads the "tuto0.cpe" file into the memory of the PlayStation 
   developer board and executes the program.


-----------------------------
  How to run the CD samples
-----------------------------
In order to run the cdrom samples in "psx\sample\cd" and in "psx\sample\sound",

1. Put the Programmer Tools CD-ROM into the DTL-H2010 or the DTL-H2510 CD-ROM
drives. 

2. Change to the directory, "psx\sample\cd\movie".  Type
	
	cd <parent-directory>\psx\sample\cd\movie

3. Type 

		psymake

   to make all of the tutorials.  After all the samples have finished
   compiling, you can do the next step.

4.  Type 

		resetps 1

    to reset the board.

5. If (and only if) you are running the DTL-H2000 board, type the following:

		run <parent-dir>\psyq\snpatch.cpe

   The file "snapatch.cpe" fixes a bug in the ROM of the DTL-H2000 board.
   DTL-H2500 users must not run this patch. 

6. Type

		run <parent-directory>\psyq\selcd

   This instructs the development board to use the CD-ROM drive (rather
   than the CD-ROM Emulator) during routines that use the CD-ROM (such
   as CdInit()).

7. Type 
	
		resetps  1

   to reset the board (it is now ready to run CD commands).

8. If (and only if) you are running the DTL-H2000 board, type the following:

		run <parent-dir>\psyq\snpatch.cpe

   The file "snapatch.cpe" fixes a bug in the ROM of the DTL-H2000 board.
   DTL-H2500 users must not run this patch. 

9. Type

		run tuto0.cpe

You should see a vivid movie of a spaceship flying around the screen.
If you look inside the file "tuto0.c", on line 32, is the file name 
"\\data\\mov.str;1".  If you load your Programmer Tools CDROM into the
PC's CDROM drive, you will indeed find the file "\data\mov.str".

.\scee\subdiv: Alternative polygon subdivision routines.
	Contributed by Derek Leigh-Gilchrist.  This does a fast texture
	mapping to flat and shaded triangles and quadrilaterals.
	Use the following control pad buttons:

		SELECT   = change poly type (Flat triangle, Gourad triangle, 
				    flat quadrilateral, Gourad triangle)
		START    = pause rotation
		LEFT     = reduce amount of subdivision (0=no subdivide, 
						     1= split into 4 polys, 
						     2=split into 16 polys)
		RIGHT    = increase amount of subdivision
		UP       = ZOOM OUT
		DOWN     = ZOOM IN
		SQUARE   = rotate Y(-)
		CIRCLE   = rotate Y(+)
		CROSS    = rotate X(-)
		TRIANGLE = rotate X(+)


.\scee\utils\except: Example exception handler.
	Contributed by Brian Marshall, this is an exception handler that
	is compatible for versions 3.1 and 3.2 of the library.  It is pretty

.\sound\balls: combination of the sound and graphics
        Example of combination of sound and graphics.
        While pressing a button, balls bounce in the screen.
        When they hit against the wall, different sounds for each 
        ball are generated.
        SEQ data is used as the background music.

.\sound\basic: Basic play 1
        SEQ/SEP data processing function sample.
        SEQ and SEP data may be played simultaneously.
        SEP data consists of 3-connected SEQ data.

.\sound\cdvol: SPU decoded data reading sample <libspu>
        Music played on the CD is read as the "SPU decoded data" from the 
        SPU in the background, and the volume is displayed with a graph 
        (with the display of the peak level).

.\sound\mutual: Wave form data divided transfer sample <libsnd> 
        At a timing divided wave form data is read into the main memory, 
        and transferred to the sound buffer. This process is repeated 
        until all parts are transferred. As a result, 2 pieces of music 
        may be played.

.\sound\tuto: Basic usage of basic sound library <libspu>
        tuto1: Pitch designation/key-on/key-off
                According to the control-pad operations, a sound is 
                played with variable pitches.
        tuto2: Mute
                Performing the sound generation, mute-on, mute-off
        tuto3: SPU interrupt
                Setting a interrupt in the middle of piano sound data.
                When the piano sound starts, and the interrupt 
                occurs, a sine wave is generated.
        tuto4: Noise sound source
                Generating a sine wave and noise by changing a pitch.
        tuto5: Divided transfer of wave form data
                Alternating divided transfer and sound 
                generation after the transfer in 2 voices.
        tuto6: Reverb
                Generating a piano sound and designating 9 kinds 
                of reverbs for the sound.
